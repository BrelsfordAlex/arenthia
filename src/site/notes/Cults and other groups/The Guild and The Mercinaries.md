members rotate towns and cities every x years and max 100 people and one in each settlement and more in big cities. NOT Lanzia or Fae area. can be called the different thing in places. same  concept though. 

obasa - similar set up called  ( name )
Oceron- run by elves and self policing (Thenaris is scary uwu. Scary mommy step on me) (vigilantes?!? utopia? america of Arenthia)

there are mercenaries for hire that are background checked by the guild
not everyone carries weapons so these people are protectors or even fight so mercenaries are in high demand. 

Villages hire sets of 3 mercenaries if they feel unprotected and pay it with free housing and discounted food and a pay. 

guild hates the [[Cults and other groups/The Order of V\|The Order of V]] (thieves guild but not its the shadke thieves guild against the real one)
