Rudoran "Ruddy" loves music, ever since he was young he enjoyed watching the minstrels play in the bars and streets. In his mind, he thought "I'm gonna do that, but BIGGER" 

Bigger was the word there, Ruddy grew up to be this massive warhorse. He wasn't built for delicate dancing, but by god he was gonna do it anyway.

He's been honing his craft for years, but he wants to see the world. He has a lot of strength, but not much wisdom, leading to the interesting mess that is Ruddy. 

He's under the assumption that the group all know how to dance and play music and for some reason he will not let go of that fantasy. In his mind, we are a traveling band of artists...even if the others haven't found their craft yet.
