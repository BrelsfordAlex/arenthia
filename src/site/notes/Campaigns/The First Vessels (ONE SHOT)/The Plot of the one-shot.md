# Do it for the plot ~={orange}uwu=~
## **The Beginning**
- Before hand let everyone just get to know [[Notable People (Still Alive)/Yania the Wise One\|Yania the Wise One]] and the people in the town and then show the incident
- Description of town ~={cyan}This is the Town of Wolfwood. A very small village of the northern coast of [[Nations of Arenthia/Eshya\|Eshya]]. While this town seems small it seems to flock many religious pilgrams and people looking for the famous wise woman [[Notable People (Still Alive)/Yania the Wise One\|Yania the Wise One]]. Yania is known world wide as one of the kindest and most knowledgeable person in the entire world. The village of Wolfwood has a small port to the north and to the south is a forest that seems to stretch for  miles. While one can see the path that should be there, sometimes the trees  would just hide the path from travelers, which is why [[Campaigns/The First Vessels (ONE SHOT)/The People of Wolfwood\|Kelvin]] stays in the forests. Kelvin is this wooden Warforged Dryad who seems to be able to combat the trees and their trickery. In the center of town is two large blue crystals that to even the people not in tune with magic can feel their power radiating off of them. All around the village you would see these thick tree roots coming in and out of the ground and would know it came from [[Nations of Arenthia/the Life Tree\|the Life Tree]]. The Life Tree is the tree in the center of everything and it seems not many people know much about its origins, all the common person would know is the tree is always watching. There is an old inn in town called the "The Dwarven Rats Pub". The Bartender of this pub yes does have rats that carry your food to you but also is a Giraffe Centaur that is bout 6 foot 2 and seems to be well built for her age of 32.The town runs with the Mercenaries called the "Brooding Dogs". Mercenarys in this world tend to work in  one city for 10 years and then switch to another city to work there. the mayor of the city is this old man who seems to be lovestruck with the local priest. =~
- ~={red}We start the one shot by going into the Tavern (The Dwarven Rats Pub) of the city, it is the night of the First of Hearthhold. One full day before the first festival of the year.  At the bar is this woman wearing a cowboy hat; there is beautiful music being played  on the stage, with a elven wizard sitting at a table watching the musician. In the corner of the room there is a hooded woman talking seemingly to a skeleton. The Camera pans down to see like mid 20s yellow tanned skin with giraffe spots and  these small ossicones (the horns) on her head. she has this long brown hair down to her elven waist. She is wearing this simple cloth over her upper half. you all would hear her fighting with a patron of the bar. This Black skinned zebra centaur wearing no shirt and tons of foreign jewelry (Ash make History check DC 17 - the jewelry is from Laznia).   He has braided hair colored in Black and White and he seems way to drunk for 8pm. =~
	- Nightseer: Fari babe give me another shot
	- Fari: Seer you have had to much drink your water *She ignores him and serves Vera a drink* here you go doll. On the house for protecting the town
	- Nightseer: *yelling* FARI you can't ignore me! I'm asking for another fucking shot! *he slams his hands on the bar.*
	- Fari: *Wincing*
	~={red}At this point have the camera center on Vera. Ask Vera what she would do as this person seems to be getting more violent by the second. After Vera handles him have Her describe herself.  Fari offers Vera another drink and explains that, "That was Nightseer, he gets really drunk at the first of the year no one knows why"
	Camera pans towards the stage to show Ruddy playing a lovely song which had been paused by the commotion earlier. (JEN DESCRIBES HIM). Ruddy looking down and in the center seeing this elf sipping a drink and eating what seems to look like some chicken tenders with this sauce. (K Describes his character). Allow for Ruddy and Theodin to talk if they want to for a minute. The Camera pans over to the corner of the room to the young woman talking to this cloaked skeleton. Ash describes herself. Ask everyone what would they do with the rest of the evening?=~
- Start with saying where each character would be resting. ~={yellow}Ash=~ would be in the Inn with ~={orange}Ruddy=~. Meanwhile ~={green}Vera=~ would be in building 1, the sherrifs house with ~={purple}Dr Theodin.=~ 
	- What the characters are each here for 
		- Ash - ~={yellow}**you are here to help keep the ship safe as the speakers of the dead travel along on foot to gather the dead.**=~
		- Ruddy -~={orange}**You are here to talk and learn more music from [[Notable People (Still Alive)/Yania the Wise One\|Yania the Wise One]] you have been training with her for awhile in the art of using music to help spin magic.**=~
		- Vera - ~={green}**You are here as the towns sheriff. you have been in this town for 6 years, your underlings are Francis Farlight a minotour,  Trigani Niniana Banfyx Elkini a dwarf, and Luanda Mistsplitter a giraffe Centaur. You act as the highest authority in the town. Handling all forms of crime. though you answer to a person called "the Raven" who leads the Guild in all of [[Nations of Arenthia/Eshya\|Eshya]]**=~
		- Theodin - ~={purple}**You are in town because you have been looking for someone or something called The Invisible Archer (Quest level B) who has been killing off people at random while wandering the forest called Barlain Crossroads Forest. You requested from the guild to work in Wolfwood to look into this matter. You are a part of a Mercinary group called "The Wizard Hunters" A group of wizards that specialize in different schools of magic and take on requests that are about finding people or even killing some person or group. Each Wizard works alone unless the quest is S rank or higher.**=~
- **Have the group enjoy a few days before the festival and the festival on the 3rd of Hearthhold**
	- Start off on the night of the  1st of Hearthhold Year 532. 
		- 2 days of getting to know eachother 
				- After the feast we start to hear stories from Destrian about how the world was before the tree and ~={yellow}then Yania is killed=~. Pausing all activities for the rest of the day. 
					- **~={red}THE KILLER MUST ESCAPE=~**
				- Ask for initiative during the first feast but dont do round to round till after she dies and then ask what everyone would do as a reaction. Allow for either minor combat or chasing false truthes
				- After she dies it starts to rain heavily
		- After the party tries to handle the situation they would hear [[Campaigns/The First Vessels (ONE SHOT)/The People of Wolfwood\|Trigani Niniana]] screaming and threatening [[Campaigns/The First Vessels (ONE SHOT)/The People of Wolfwood\|Va-tnilaus]] who is covered in Yania's blood **the party should know by know he is her child** and Va is just begging Trigani to stop and that shes hurting him. 
			- "Pain? you killed the Wise woman you *dirty dragon*" - Trig

			- Luanda is no where to be found
			- **Let the Party Intervene**
		- paths they could do

			- Luanda If asked will say she wasn't in town and will act suspicious 
			- **Trigani** is the one screaming at the kid
			- **Fari**  mentions seeing a genie at her bar that night that was new to town and when she asked he just said he was there for some business which she thought was odd

			- if they ask the library person they will mention a wereboar could have done it 
	- #### **That Night**
		- Everyone has a dream of a child approaching them. Each child looks different.
			- Ash - ~={yellow}Her child appears shrounded in black mist, wearing the mask of a fox that seems to be cracked  coming out of this. this child crosses his arms and looks at Ash, "You seem to be lost ma'am can I help" and offers his hand to her. IF ASH SAYS NO "That's ok I'm not lost either. How is my pet dragon? is he ok?" =~	
			- Vera -~={green} Her Child seems to be changing, fighting itself. It first was this soft blue haired human child then this flaming haired child then to a child that seems to be shrounded in red aura and hard to see details. The child and the background seems to be changing. Will hear the 3 different ones fighting saying like "Get away from her", "Rania help it hurt", "Shut up" and then the red aura child will smile at Vera and say "Someones done some bad can you help me?" =~
			- Ruddy -~={orange} a child covered in dirt, blue overalls, brown hair, with this glowing smile coming out of this faded farm house. "Hi! Welcome to the farm! Wanna help!" =~
			- Theodin -~={purple} the child seems to come from a fallen star, shrouded in this calming yellow mist, black skin, long thick black hair with flowers in it "Oh you seem lost... this is my home... where are you supposed to be?" =~
		- The children will each try to guide the characters into their house and offer food. the goal for this is to get the gods blessing.

- Incident happens everyone is in the town (change teleport thing)
- everyone is asleep, dreaming. each person sees a child (every child is different)  the children ask each character to take their hand and help find the killer and bring them to godly justice. 
	- **what each person sees:**
		- for Ash its a young dark elven child with glowing white eyes.  (ends up being [[The gods/Ulfera the Grave Father\|Ulfera]])
		- For Erran it is a child that is almost made of pure red magic. the eyes are flames *can make ~={orange}perception check dc 17=~ to see inside of the child is a figure curled up surrounded by fire but ice seems to be covering the fire* (ends up being [[The gods/Heris The Flame Queen\|Heris]] then into [[Notable People (Still Alive)/Zelaniar\|Zelaniar]] )

	- In the dream the child shows the characters  the beheaded body of [[Notable People (Still Alive)/Yania the Wise One\|Yania the Wise One]] *with a ~={orange}perception check dc 16+=~ the character can see the shape of a hooded figure. if the roll is ~={orange}above a 20=~ they can tell its a genie* and then the vision flashes to  the vision of the child turning into a god and asking for help to "Fix what has been wronged"
		- **the Task:** "fix what has been wronged"
			- Meaning: Find the killer of [[Notable People (Still Alive)/Yania the Wise One\|Yania the Wise One]] and bring him to justice.
	-  [[Nations of Arenthia/Eshya\|Eshya]]  **Wolfwood**
			  
- **if they take the childs hand** the child turns into a god and grants each person a symbol of the god to act as their vessel (though they dont know this) to show the godly authority
- **if they don't take the child's hand** the gods force the items on the person and bind their actions to the task and the items gain a curse
****


- *Can make i~={orange}nsight check dc 10=~ to see in the sky (number of players) amount of moons in the sky*
		- ~={red}This isnt normal=~
		- Each moon is a symbol of the gods that each character talked to. the one for [[The gods/Heris The Flame Queen\|Heris The Flame Queen]] is cracking and breaking into floating pieces
****

**People they could meet of importance in the village**
- [[Notable People (Still Alive)/the Library Leader\|the Library Leader]]
- [[Cults and other groups/The Order of V\|The Order of V]]
- Anyone in [[Campaigns/The First Vessels (ONE SHOT)/The People of Wolfwood\|The People of Wolfwood]]

## The Middle
- **if they follow the Luanda case** 
	- townspeople will say every new moon and fullmoon Luanda disappears and never attends any of the moon festivals which is odd but most people learn to ignore it
	- Luanda will act defensive and get upset saying "I just prefer to have a personal festival is that so wrong" and will say when Yania was killed she was away 
		- Etti can confirm this and will explain how he took her on a date as a lie (party rolls **Deception dc 14** to tell its a lie)
			- they are dating your honor
	- Steve will chime in saying to Ash that it is very odd
	- Luanda will then tell them that there has been some stuck up noble in town for the past month and he got here around the ~={cyan}21st of Lamiahold.=~ He was seen talking with a Genie who came in with him.
	- Etti will continue and say "The stranger was seen going out of the village and into the **Barlain Crossroads Forest**"
		- If they ask if how to get there Etti will say "I live there I can show you"
			- will get the information from Aiduin without persuasion

## The End
The group finds [[Campaigns/The First Vessels (ONE SHOT)/Henreich Gaki\|Henreich Gaki]] on his way ==to the Volcano of Urva while following the East coast of [[Nations of Arenthia/Eshya\|Eshya]] in the **Barlain Crossroads Forest**== a forest known for its empty feeling. No creatures live in this forest and it is enchanted by a fae called Aiduin Glavien. 
```statblock
creature: Sprite
name: Aiduin Glavien
spells:
  - Topsy turvy - This spell allows the user to confuse the targets in a 30 ft cone. The targets must roll a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure the target rolls all attacks at disadvantage and can reroll the save at the start of each turn. On a success the user cannot be affected by this again for 24 hours.
hit_dice: 21d20
type: Fae
actions:
  - name: Scimitar
    desc: Mele Weapon Attack- +6 to hit (9), range 40/160 ft., one target. Hit- 3 (1d6) piercing damage
  - name: Short bow
    desc:Ranged Weapon Attack- +6 to hit (
9), range 40/160 ft., one target. Hit- 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
  - name: Heart Sight 
    desc: The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.
```

- He knows where Henreich is and upon convincing him to show where the Assassin is (via any method) he will lead the party to a small cavern  where Henreich sits resting. 
	- *if they choose to attack the fae welp lets hope they can survive lmao*

### meeting Henreich

- when the party meets him he is using speak with dead on the Yania head
	- Questions he asks
		1. ==How did the Gods get into power==
			- The gods went into power by killing a previous god when they were mortal. the killing of the god ended [[The Eras/The Era of Gods\|The Era of Gods]] and the world was sunk into ruins with magic being unstable the world looked to the 6 hero gods for help as they fought the old gods for power. The imbalance in nature lead to the creation of the life tree as [[The gods/Thenaris The Mother of All\|Thenaris]] used the last of her clerical powers to create a new magic a better magic. [[The Magic of Arenthia/The Types of Magic/Details about Root Magic\|Root Magic]] and so the tree was created to watch over all of her new kin
		2. how did you live so long
			- I am part Elf
		3. do you know who killed you 
			- No
		4. how can I create a new era
			- I refuse to answer
		5. how can the Life tree be destroyed
			- I cannot answer
	- ==if the party listens== before engaging they will hear all of this and him getting frustrated and throwing the head and will hear a voice of [[Notable People (Still Alive)/Zelaniar\|Zelaniar]] (==who Erann met in the beginning==) telling Henreich to "Calm yourself we shall bring a better era soon...." in a motherly tone
	- **the party fights him**
	- if time the party can go on to find the group he worked with revealing Steve was a traitor
