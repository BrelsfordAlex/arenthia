**Ash-Arva:** Med check. Oh, yes.
**DM:** Not yet. In an hour.
**Theodin:** Well, I got two people.
**Ash-Arva:** I have taken my meds for today. I am fine. Well, actually, at four, they're just closer to my meds than I am. Pull up for me once I open it. Please. Thank you. Yes. I hold your Aussie. You hold my Aussie.
**Theodin:** Hi. I am unmedicated because I cannot afford insurance.
**Vera:** Oh. I mean, my medication is still trying to fix my alcoholism, so there's that. Uh-huh.
**Theodin:** I need to be matted up for ADHD, but I'm not. I haven't been matted for ADHD in eight months in seven years. Yeah. And right now, I yeah. And I have a caffeine and nicotine addiction. So Great.
**Ash-Arva:** Yes. Welcome to the ADHD club. Oh, shit. Hey. There we go.
**DM:** So yeah. Fair. Me with a caffeine addiction. Unlike Court, I'm not just jumping straight into this.
**Ash-Arva:** Uh-huh. Well, unlike me, this is a first session.
**DM:** Yeah.
**Ash-Arva:** We might briefly mute because I'm going to go for a quick pass, but I will still be able to hear you.
**DM:** Yeah. So just just like, to get back into character because I stole this from one of the p and d people. I
**DM:** Answer this as your character, by the way. Okay?
**DM:** What would your characters say to their younger self?
**DM:** K. Let's start with you.
**Theodin:** You have much to learn. Fear not the intricacies of how you gather your knowledge.
**Theodin:** Do not think you know what is best just because you outlived a few humans.
**Theodin:** There is always more knowledge to gather, and in all of its facets, you will never be prepared for what comes next.
**Theodin:** Another mistake. Every mistake is another step towards another mistake.
**DM:** Fair, Jen. You're next.
**Ruddy:** Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Every mistake is a, a step towards what's it called? Hold on. That's canon. That's canon. That's a mistake. Every mistake. Every mistake is a step towards your your progress. You'll get there eventually. You just gotta keep moving.
**Ash-Arva:** I I have Ava's proper one. I have Ash's proper one. The struggle of life will be worth it.
**Ash-Arva:** Do your best, and he will exalt us in our death.
**DM:** Armory, what about you?
**Vera:** What was the question?
**DM:** What is one thing your character would love to say to their younger self?
**Vera:** That can't say that. That's not PG.
**DM:** Are we ever PG?
**Theodin:** Hey. Hey. This is this this is not a PG session. Alright?
**Ash-Arva:** This is not a PG session.
**Ash-Arva:** Live fast, die whenever.
**Ash-Arva:** That's another one actually probably states their focus.
**Vera:** Think not of what your parents think of who you are. You are going to go far. Oh, what a little gay.
**DM:** I'm gonna answer this as an NPC you would all know.
**DM:** This is I'm gonna answer this as an NPC you would all know.
**DM:** This n p c is called Yania the wise one or the knowledge keeper depending on who you ask. She is a old centaur that everyone knows.
**DM:** She is the oldest living person on the planet.
**DM:** If she could tell her younger self one thing.
**DM:** She would gladly tell herself.
**DM:** Don't worry about the wars. Don't worry about the danger.
**DM:** Don't worry about the people you lose along the way.
**DM:** Move one foot in front of the other.
**Ash-Arva:** I I've read it in VC text, but Ash thinks she's a bit of a bitch. Well, that's a cultural thing.
**DM:** Yeah. So okay. I have to pull my thing up.
**DM:** So we all start in well, you all start in the town of Wolfwood. It's a very small coast on the, it's a very small village on the Northern Coast Of Esya, and for context, this is that village. Hold on. I need to because I realize people don't know where it is.
**Vera:** No. You put it in VC tags.
**DM:** No. That's the village map, but where it's located.
**Vera:** It's located. Oh. Because Oh, did you get shown when I was telling you?
**Ash-Arva:** No. This is something we've worked on for a couple of weeks. Oh. The the location and things. 
**Vera:** Okay. 
**Ash-Arva:** Because it's mildly relevant. Like, you and you and Kay's job only exist on this continent.
**DM:** The map is loading.
**Ash-Arva:** Sorry? Your your job and Keith's job only exist on this continent. Mhmm. So you're in that one there. I'm gonna pretend
**DM:** Yep. And then this is the map of the continent that you guys are on.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. Yeah. Oh, no. We're up here.
**DM:** You guy you see the name Wolfood. It is a very small village on the Northern Coast, and while it does seem small, many people seem to flock to the village for religious reasons. They're looking to talk to Yania to get guidance because they seek knowledge from the person who's lived longer than time itself.
**Ash-Arva:** They seek that one d four on the next skill check.
**DM:** Actually, it's more like a d eight.
**DM:** Yania, like I said, is known as worldwide is one of the kindest and most knowledgeable person in the entire
**DM:** Village of Wolfwood has a small port to the North, and to the South is a forest that seems to stretch for miles. Seems like it doesn't end even though logically you know that it should.
**DM:** Well, when you're in the village, you can't see a path that there would be to travel through. When you step foot into that forest, the path is gone.
**DM:** There is a wooden warforged dryad who seems to be able to combat the magical nature of this forest to make sure that people can get to where they need these who seems to know the trickery of the woods. In the center of town, there is two large blue crystals that radiate with this very powerful magic.
**DM:** This is what people flock to.
**DM:** All around the village, you'd see these thick tree roots coming in and out of the grounds, and people just seem to be walking around them. And you guys would note that it would come from the life tree itself sitting that sits directly in the middle of the world.
**DM:** Life tree is the center of everything, and Nadol many nodes seem to know its origins, and just a common person would know that tree is always watching.
**DM:** Are not without being watched.
**DM:** There is no darkness to where you could landscape without it knowing.
**DM:** There is an old inn in the town called the Dwarven Rat Pub. The bartender of this pub, yes, in fact, does have rats. Six of them to be exact.
**Theodin:** Etti. Rats. Where are the rats?
**DM:** Yes. Exactly.
**Ash-Arva:** Where the rats? Rats, go away, please. Please, rats. Go away.
**Theodin:** I am so sorry.
**Ash-Arva:** No. You're good. They were already coming when you said that.
**DM:** The rats will carry the food for you. The rats will carry your food to you, and the bartender is about six foot tall female giraffe centaur who seems to be built built for her age. And I have a picture of her since I can throw over the fuck is she.
**Theodin:** Are very mature for your no.
**Ash-Arva:** Hey, yo.
**Ruddy:** Hey.
**Theodin:** I'm sorry. Like, I'm sorry. I couldn't hold back making a making a joke.
**Ruddy:** She's so pretty.
**DM:** The bartender's name is Vera Bronzehide, and she has worked at this bar for many. She has she has a pet dragon hatchling named Molly.
**DM:** Is this almost bay like dragon.
**DM:** The town runs with the mercenaries called the brooding dogs. The mercenaries in this world tend to work basically like the operators in Rekko. They're they're basically
**DM:** And they but the difference is the mercenaries switch every ten years between villages, so they don't get too complacent.
**DM:** The mayor of this town seems to be this old man who's lovestruck by the local priest. This is what you all would know. And we're starting by going to the tavern of the city, and it's the first of the year. First night of the year. Everyone's partying. It's a very joyous time. There is
**DM:** In the bar there is a woman wearing a cowboy hat, there's beautiful music being played on the stage, an elf and wizard sitting and watching the musician, and in the corner of the room, a woman seemingly talking to something.
**Ash-Arva:** He he the thing the woman is talking to is in a long, almost monk's habit. Howl completely covering their face and just not responding to the woman. The woman is dressed very interestingly, but that's not the point.
**DM:** The camera
**DM:** We start this by seeing this seeing the mid twenties yellow tanned giraffe center, the bartender.
**DM:** She has the bra long brown hair down to her like her waist ish, if you can consider that a waist.
**DM:** She's a bartender.
**Theodin:** Tell me which waist.
**Ruddy:** Okay. Okay.
**DM:** It takes like the human part. The human part. Or elven ways. She's of elven in centaur blood.
**DM:** She's wearing just a simple cloth covering her upper half and you all hear her fighting with someone at the bar. This black skinned zebra centaur is wearing no shirt but a ton of fucking jewelry that seems to be
**DM:** Four into this part of the world.
**DM:** Ash, if you would like, can make a history check on this jewelry for reasons.
**Ash-Arva:** For reasons? I love reasons. I love reasons, that one. I kind of wanna see if I pay attention, though.
**Ash-Arva:** Am I am I actually paying attention to this? Do I care enough?
**Ash-Arva:** I might. I'll rule the history. I am not paying attention. I got an eight. I am not paying attention.
**DM:** Jewelry seems familiar, but you don't know why.
**DM:** He has this braided hair with black and white streaks, but he seems to be drunk, and it's only 11:00 at night.
**DM:** The the shops are just closed, and he is already dropped.
**DM:** He just you see him shouting, Vera, babe. Give me another shot. You see this the giraffe centaur sigh and just shake her head and go, William, you have had way too much to drink. Drink your fucking water.
**DM:** And you see her grab a mug of what looks like to be there and hand it to the woman wearing a cowboy hat. Here you go, doll. On the house for protecting the town.
**DM:** The zebra centaur.
**DM:** Cut that.
**Vera:** I've told you before, I don't like taking things for free, but given the situation that I'm going to have to handle in a moment with our dear pain in the back save, William, I appreciate it.
**DM:** William starts yelling, you can't fucking ignore me. I'm asking for another shot, and he slams his hand on the mark.
**Vera:** In response, Vera sighs heavily turns to the bartender and just goes
**Vera:**This for me and slants her own hand on the bar, stands up and goes, William, you're cut off. You're coming with me now.
**DM:** You get up, can you describe yourself?
**Vera:** So
**Vera:** I'm assuming at this point Ash is actually paying attention. 
**Ash-Arva:** No. 
**Vera:** No? Okay. 
**Ash-Arva:** Ash is having a very animated call conversation with an animated corpse.
**Vera:** Hello. Well, I'll do it. So everybody watching would see a, like, relatively fair skinned, six foot tall,
**Vera:** Elven woman slam her hand on the desk. Oh, not the desk. Hello, Erann. The bar and
**Vera:** If you're looking at her from behind, she has a quiver on her back, but interestingly, she also has one on her hip.
**Vera:** Two scimitars and a longbow.
**Vera:** And she's in what looks to be studded leather. She, oh, dear Christ. K. What's your character's name?
**Theodin:** No. Wrong one. Theoden.
**Theodin:** T  h e o d e n.
**Vera:** Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right. No. Sorry. I had to go into the campaigns of, like, get the list of people because I'm small brain right now.
**Theodin:** Theoden.
**DM:** Were just kicking William out of the ball.
**Ash-Arva:** You're about to kick William out of the bar. How are you going to do it? We don't know yet. You slammed your hand on the table. That's
**Ash-Arva:** You're okay with that one. Take a second. 
**Vera:** No. But I did say what I said. 
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. And then Yeah. You said you said that, and then nothing else had happened yet. But you described yourself. 
**Vera:** Oh, right.
**Vera:** So she, like, slams her hand on this bar.
**Vera:** What walks over oh, yes. She's wearing a cowboy hat. A fancy looking cowboy hat. Yes.
**DM:** You seem in the right light, it seems to have a glimpse of a blade in the room.
**Theodin:** That is Maddie Black. Got the boots in black.
**Vera:** Oh, if
**DM:** Can just yeah. Just continue going.
**Vera:** And so so I'm really bad at describing characters for a second. I'd recommend just continuing. Okay. K. Oh, just continue. And she
**Ruddy:** Great. Hold on, guys. My headphones turned off.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh? Oh, okay. No worries. Returning first headphones.
**DM:** Headphones.
**Ruddy:** Okay. I can hear you guys now.
**Vera:** And so she looking very, very teched off.
**Vera:** Walks over to the sky, William, and just goes, hey, Buzzy. You're off again.
**Vera:** Time to go.
**Ruddy:** Oh my god.
**Ruddy:** Can't deal with this right now.
**Vera:** And she doesn't even give him a chance to bond because she knows exactly what this man is like and scrups him by the back of his neck and drags him out of this bar.
**DM:** He isn't fighting. He knows better than to fight you by now because you've been in this town for about six years.
**DM:** You spend like this the entire time you've been?
**DM:** Jen, is your headphones good?
**Ash-Arva:** They're unplugged. Give me a minute. 
**Vera:** No. They're not connecting properly, I don't think. 
**Ash-Arva:** Just give them a sec.
**Ruddy:** Okay. I can hear again.
**Ash-Arva:** Hello? Hello.
**Ruddy:** Just need to make sure that they're not, like, dead or something.
**DM:** Yes. Do you need a minute?
**Ruddy:** Yeah. I would appreciate that. Give me one minute.
**DM:** Yeah. You can take a minute.
**Theodin:** Everyone take five or something. I don't know.
**Ruddy:** Okay. They're plugged in. They shouldn't turn off again.
**Ruddy:** Sorry, guys. Thank you.
**Ash-Arva:** Perfect. You're amazing, Jen. No apologies. No apologies.
**DM:** Use this as a as a distraction. Okay?
**DM:** So is it Ruddy or Ruddy?
**DM:**  You see this Elven woman with a cowboy hat carry almost carry this very drunken Centaur out of the bar
**Ruddy:** Oh, dear. Is he alright?
**DM:** The bartender looks at you and just goes, hey. He's fine. He's just always drunk. It's 8PM.
**Ruddy:** Hope this early.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, if he's not drunk this early, he's an amateur, honestly.
**DM:** Ready. Will you describe yourself?
**Ruddy:** Ruddy is this, he's a tall centaur. He is a gray dappled centaur, with a very, like, short cut tail and long red hair.
**Ruddy:** He he wears this, this white button up shirt and a sort of like fur, vest that's attached with a, like, with a little belt. And he's got bracers on his, on his hoof, like, above his hoofs on his legs.
**DM:** What species of centaur are you? Remind me?
**DM:** Just a regular center. Got it.
**Theodin:** That's racist. I'm just kidding.
**Ruddy:** A regular center. Nothing special. Hey.
**Ash-Arva:** Uh-huh. Just, Jen describing the character.
**DM:** As listen. As William's being dragged out, you hear him shout, Vera. All drinks on me tonight.
**Ruddy:** Vera
**DM:** Was gonna drink and mumble.
**DM:** Think we carry wine.
**Ash-Arva:** Ash looks at the bartender and goes, what is your finest wine? And can I get at least two?
**Ash-Arva:** What is your finest drink of any variety?
**DM:** She looks you up and down, and at this point, will you describe yourself as?
**Ash-Arva:** So Ash is a quite short, probably about five six five seven. But they look taller because they are wearing, like, extremely big stiletto heels. They are wearing this I put actually a bunch of the reference stuff in the chat. This, like, almost, crop tank top leather top. This long red cape down the side with the symbol of the grandfather, the god of death on it. These, long leather, armbands with actually like a filigree bracer on one of them. I forgot how I said that one on the right arm. And
**Ash-Arva:** Like these long, big leather trousers. And she is very conventionally attractive, but she is also about whatever she seems to be drinking from a hip flask and seems to be pretty drunk at this point.
**Ruddy:** Reddy would walk up to the bartender and go, Hey! That's the spirit! Can I get some do you have any cider?
**DM:** Vera looks at both of you and goes, I have something better than cider for the both of you. She looks over at the only other person who seems to be in the bar which is
**DM:** E, elf and wizard.
**DM:** Goes, would you like one too, mister?
**Ruddy:** Hey. It's a party now. Sorry.
**Theodin:** He was act he was he was actually reading a book and then looked looked up. He had his glasses on. He would have his glasses on, and they're these big, like, circle, thin frame circle glasses. What's everyone drinking?
**DM:** I have this
**DM:** Don't wanna call it here because it's really not at this point. It's basically been aged older than the Life Tree itself.
**Ash-Arva:** Sounds great. Give me two.
**Theodin:** I'll take I'll take one.
**Ruddy:** Your stature.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, don't worry, darling. I can handle my drink. And she winks at you.
**Ruddy:** Okay. He just sort of blushes and looks away.
**DM:** You see her writing down numbers and it seems like this string is at least 10,000 gold of glass.
**Ash-Arva:** You can buy it in a sailing ship for this drink.
**DM:** No one's this is on a another customer's tab. Don't worry, darling.
**Theodin:** That was me out of character.
**DM:** And she pours oh, yeah. This is on William, the centaur that got drunkenly tossed out. Yeah.
**DM:** And she
**Ruddy:** Oh, we're going to bankrupt him.
**DM:** She pours five drinks, hands two to ash, hands one to theoden and root eat, and then has one waiting by where Barrow was sick.
**Ash-Arva:** Ash downs one of them as quickly as possible.
**DM:** Make a constitution safe for me.
**Ash-Arva:** I am resistant to poison if this helps.
**DM:** This is not poison.
**Theodin:** Mean, technically, it is.
**Ash-Arva:** Do not get close to what I have a third.
**Theodin:** Theodine would just be kind of would be nursing the drink.
**DM:** 22. Okay. You don't feel anything yet?
**Ash-Arva:** How does it taste?
**DM:** It  tastes
**DM:** Tastes almost like
**DM:** Gaged apple cider.
**DM:** You can't really place what it is.
**Ruddy:** Come on. Work.
**DM:** It's a flavor that's not been seen in the world.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, Jen. Hello?
**Theodin:** Probably your headphones again.
**DM:** I will quote we all get you in kitchen. You have
**Ash-Arva:** Hello? Hello?
**Ruddy:** I can no longer hear anyone. Hold on.
**Theodin:** Well, I would get her new headphones, but I've, in the last two weeks, had to send but in the last two weeks, I've had to send about, $350 to my roommate. So
**Ruddy:** I can hear you guys now.
**DM:** Jen, you can put us on the speaker if that's easier.
**Ruddy:** No. Because it'll echo on my mic. It's okay. If it gets if it gets like this again, I might turn on my speaker.
**DM:** Yeah. So
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. Yeah. Do that if it gets like this again.
**DM:** This drink, it seems to be like this aged apple cider with hint of something that you've never tasted before, Ash.
**Ash-Arva:** Cool. I would like to down the other one.
**DM:** Another constitution save at disadvantage.
**Ash-Arva:** From disadvantage. Oh, no. Highs are 14.
**DM:** You have to lean on the bar in order to stand up.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy is just like sipping his slowly and trying to like savor the flavor. Cause he knows he's never going to drink something like this ever again.
**DM:** Do you know the second the aftertaste of it? Something you grew up tasting.
**DM:** It's the sayer that's never there's no more seeds left.
**DM:** This drink is rarer than anything in the world.
**Ruddy:** Sort of, like, holds it close to his body, kind of, like, fearing someone will take it from him.
**Ash-Arva:** Ash throws out the hip flask.
**Ash-Arva:** It smells quite metallic, what's in there. It just takes a little swig or two of it.
**Ruddy:** Ready to sort of, like, hums to himself.
**Ash-Arva:** Way people is better than I thought, and I'll I'll hold my goal.
**DM:** She looked normal. You've seen the bartender kind of show? You see the bartender show? Vera, you want a drink? Come here.
A**Vera:** You work for the dog, must have been.
**DM:** Opened the old shit.
**Vera:** We putting things on his tab again?
**DM:** This is the old chip.
**Ash-Arva:** The old shit. If you don't want it, darling, I'll happily take your pint that's already been borrowed. Absolutely not.
**DM:** I think you've had enough.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, that's a shame. I've not had enough. 
**Vera:** Walk in a straight line. 
**Theodin:** Theoden would quiet would quietly point to a sign which says don't drink the bar.
**DM:** It's written in, like, cursive.
**Ash-Arva:** So, can I can I just try and walk in a straight line on stilettos while drunk? What is this check?
**DM:** Good question.
**Ruddy:** Would it be athletics?
**Ash-Arva:** Can I could I pass it acrobatics at disadvantage?
**DM:** You're stumbling, but you managed to walk in a diagonally straight line.
**Ash-Arva:** Like, right back to my table.
**DM:** Of something that's not there.
**Ash-Arva:** Hello? Hello? And she starts speaking something she starts speaking something completely random. She probably starts speaking Yania, like, specifically, Lansian dialect and just starts talking. And what probably the rest of you looks like talking to the person, the the robed monk that's sitting at the table?
**Ash-Arva:** And then after about probably ten seconds falls over asleep.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy looks over at the bartender and goes See I told you, she's speaking gibberish to the air!
**DM:** And don't worry, can everyone but Ash make a perception check?
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. Sure.
**Ruddy:** 21.
**Ash-Arva:** There's a 28.
**DM:** K. What'd you get?
**DM:** Damn. Perception.
**Theodin:** Okay. 20.
**DM:** You all see the skeleton move on her, but,
**Ash-Arva:** It's a monk. It's like a robed monk.
**DM:** Yeah. You see this robed monk Etti up on its own?
**DM:** Paint a coin you guys have never seen before. Put it on the table and carry Ash back to her room.
**Ruddy:** I use Anyone else get the creeps from that guy?
**DM:** Oh, that guy, he's been following around that woman all day. He he gave to it.
**Ruddy:** Is she safe?
**DM:** See if there's anyone that follows the death keepers.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. You do see the same symbol that was on Ash's, robes on this guy's robes as well.
**Ruddy:** I I hope to the tree that this is that he's just a coworker.
**Vera:** Fuck the tree.
**Vera:** And Vera just yells in response, fuck the tree, slams the, like, drink on the tankard on the table and, like, takes a massive swag.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy just looks over and goes hey now
**DM:** Vera, can you make constitution safe since you took a massive swig?
**Vera:**Yeah. Oh, balls. 10. You're all worse than I did at disadvantage. Yep.
**DM:** You start to hear whispers as well.
**Vera:** Whispers in what language?
**DM:** Language you can't understand.
**DM:** Is one word you can make out.
**Vera:** Come again? Sorry. Correct. I didn't hear that quite well.
**DM:** Yeah. All you hear in, like, this very quiet
**DM:** And then in the whispers.
**DM:** Then you hear fire.
**Ash-Arva:** Gonna give this to you briefly, and I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Okay. I am passed out upstairs. Okay.
**DM:** And then you hear a language you don't understand, and then you're back to health.
**DM:** At this point Say it again. Are you taking a drink of it as well?
**Theodin:** Yeah. Kind of just sorta like sampling it, you know, like nursing it.
**DM:** Ruddy, at this time, I need a constitution saved from you.
**Ruddy:** Is constitution? Okay. Here we go.
**Ruddy:** Oh, I crit fail three.
**DM:** You hear voice in your head.
**DM:** Beware of the shadows.
**Ruddy:** He sort of like rubs his eyes and goes, oh what's in this?
**DM:** Okay, darling?
**Ruddy:** Yeah, I'm hearing things. He sort of blinks his eyes.
**Vera:** Oh, you too?
**Ruddy:** You you're hearing things as well.
**Vera:** Quite odd, actually.
**DM:** To you two specifically, the bartender seems to have a different aura about her.
**Ruddy:** It just said, beware of the shadows.
**Vera:** I think. I've been in this okay. So I've been in this time for six years. Right?
**DM:** You've never seen this look in her before.
**Vera:** Oh, okay. That's raising alarm bells.
**DM:** Bartender looks at Theoden and goes, you alright, dear. Are you hearing what they're saying as whispers too?
**Theodin:** Who says anything about whispers?
**DM:** She looks over at the two basically passed out on the bar, Pereira and Ruddy. He says, these two are saying they're hearing whispers from that drink. You hear it too.
**Theodin:** You think someone slipped them something?
**DM:** One's ever opened this drink before.
**Theodin:** Must be my lucky day.
**DM:** At that point, you need to make constitution safe as well.
**Ruddy:** Didn't create fail like I did.
**DM:** Oh, no. The t 20 rolled away.
**Theodin:** Which is awful because I only have a plus one. Oh, goddamn it. Where did no. The my my die fell off. Yeah. It fell off the fucking 19.
**DM:** You feel fine at first, but then as she mentions the voices, she's giving you a look.
**DM:** And slowly.
**DM:** You start to hear, like, little sparkles in your head, like, tinging sounds, like you're tapping on Etti. And you also hear this
**DM:** Pois, festas.
**DM:** Go to sleep, and I can give you a dream.
**Theodin:** Someone must be playing tricks. Either that or someone sip to sip something in my drink too. I think I know what they're talking about.
**DM:** You you saw me open this. I just opened it today. I I
**DM:** She doesn't take a sip of her glass.
**Theodin:** Haven't you drank any of it yet?
**DM:** It's 08:00, and I gotta work, and this is just drop shit.
**Theodin:** DM. Can I do a a history? Wait. Actually, hold on. Barkeep. Can I see the bottle, please?
**DM:** Check. You can't see the bottle and the label seems to almost be starting to fade. It's there's words on it. You can't under
**Theodin:** I do a history check on it?
**Theodin:** How's the 22?
**DM:** You would know.
**DM:** That this string
**DM:** From where you're employed, which is the wizard hunters guild.
**DM:** They warned you about this.
**DM:** Why that seems to be
**DM:** Within a few days of drinking, it seems to give people vivid dreams or nightmares of some
**DM:** Some people go crazy by hearing, and other people
**DM:** They seem to have a mission.
**DM:** There is,
**DM:** You hit a 20, you notice on the bottle
**DM:** Is a symbol of a god you do not recognize
**Theodin:** Theoden would kinda just nudge his glass away from him. Look at the barkeep.
**Theodin:** Yeah. You might want to keep this bottle tucked away so that you can pour it out at some point.
**Ruddy:** He just falls back onto the onto the bar.
**Theodin:** Healthy mind is one without intrusion.
**DM:** Sometimes intrusions are good depending on who it is.
**DM:** She shakes Vera awake.
**Theodin:** Well, I've I've lived I've lived the last three hundred and eighty years of my life without anyone probing my mind. I think I can do another century without that.
**Vera:** Sorry. Hello?
**DM:** As Ruddy falls asleep, one of the other you do see just a clump of rats take Ruddy up to her room, up to his room.
**Theodin:** And you can just barely hear them whispering. Ratz. Ratz. We're the Ratz. I'm I'm so sorry.
**Ash-Arva:** We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats We're there rats 
**DM:** Vera, are you falling asleep too?
**Theodin:** No. Undisitely lazy.
**Ash-Arva:** Does Vera manage to stumble home first?
**Vera:** No. Not falling asleep, trying to stay awake. Not anymore. There's a blanket.
**Ruddy:** As Ruddy gets- as Ruddy gets carried upstairs, he's probably mumbling something about like, I don't like all your tiny paws.
**Theodin:** Touch me. Touch me harder.
**Ruddy:** No. Oh my god.
**DM:** You can carry your instrument upstairs.
**DM:** With very delicate care.
**Ruddy:** Don't break at all. Break you.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, oh, he's so cute when he's threatening people.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, all is
**Theodin:** Yes.
**Theodin:** Yeah. I inhaled wrong.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, no. The bad air.
**Theodin:** Alright. I'm I'm I'm good.
**Vera:** Maybe you're okay. How tall is Theoden?
**Theodin:** Six foot two and only, like, a hundred and seventy five pounds.
**Ash-Arva:** Hieß es.
**Theodin:** He's thin. He's not skinny.
**Ash-Arva:** Fairness, so is that. Yeah.
**Vera:** So Vera struggling to stay upright. Reminder, she's six foot. Just sort of, like, almost seemingly struggling to move towards the Theoden and goes, Theoden, can you help me home, please?
**Theodin:** Theoden would kinda roll his eyes and be like, sure. Where do you live?
**DM:** Same place you're going to sleep at the Sheriff's House.
**Ash-Arva:** As Vera is the sheriff. Vera is the sheriff.
**Theodin:** Oh, right. Once again, he would roll his eyes, and then he'd go, sure. Let's go.
**DM:** As you two are walking home, you hear William Faroff shouting at someone and in the distance you see this like almost gremlin like creature sitting on top of the sheriff's house just twisting and turning his head watching.
**Ruddy:** Yeah. What's his deal?
**Ash-Arva:** It who I think it is?
**DM:** Yes. You you both would know that this is a about 16 year old Cobalt named shit. I can't remember the rest of his fucking last name. Hold on.
**DM:** It's Va-Tilnalus.
**Ash-Arva:** Vertanos.
**Ruddy:** Mhmm. That is all of this.
**DM:** And he just kind of watches he watches you guys for a moment and goes, get sleep quickly. There's storm coming.
**Theodin:** Thank you. We'll be on our way.
**Ruddy:** Oh, come on.
**Vera:** Very just so slow. Okay. I'm getting into too much trouble.
**Theodin:** Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go
**DM:** Orders are coming. Be careful.
**DM:** Orders are coming. Be careful.
**DM:** I can't speak to Much because they could be watching.
**Theodin:** Okay. And they would continue on their way just heading back to the Sheriff's Office.
**DM:** Alrighty. You managed to get back there, and you both comfortably fall asleep in your bed. And
**Vera:** Better just collapses. It's like I've called it.
**DM:** No drinks tonight.
**DM:** It is the morning of the second of Hearthold, a day before the first full moon of the year. Everyone is getting ready for the festival. The festival of the full moon is where people just work late to the night. They spend time having fun, and you guys would note that in this village, there is a thing called rat races.
**Ruddy:** Hold my money on the worst rat.
**Ash-Arva:** All my money on the best rap. Ash doesn't
**DM:** There is not a there's not a cloud in the sky.
**Ash-Arva:** Ash doesn't sleep that much, do they?
**Ash-Arva:** Ash is probably up early morning tending the graveyard then because we're not here often.
**Ash-Arva:** When I say she's tending the graveyard, the monk is tending the graveyard. She is supervising with a glass of wine. Yes. Wine.
**Ash-Arva:** Yes. Why?
**DM:** While you're in the graveyard, this 82 year old human walks up tangos.
**DM:** Darling, are you here from the great father?
**Ash-Arva:** Yes. Don't worry, young man.
**DM:** And we call that years.
**Ash-Arva:** A shame, truly.
**DM:** It'll be my time soon enough.
**Ash-Arva:** Like, a small wake.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, don't worry. Death is not that scary.
**DM:** A very unsneakly way, you think you see this old man peeking behind a tree just watching her holding up bouquet of flowers.
**DM:** There's an old man watching the old woman with a bouquet of flowers in it with a little pigeon on his shoulder, and he's too scared to approach. He's not being
**Ash-Arva:** I I, like, sidle to the side so this woman can't quite see one of my arms and just, like, wave to him. Like, come forward. Come on.
**DM:** You hear an audible, like no. No. No. No. And then you hear
**DM:** Surprisingly, the pigeon talks and goes, if you don't go up there, so help me, Destran. Fine. Fine.
**Ash-Arva:** And I kind of just make myself busy, and I go, oh, I have things to attend to, things to prepare. It was lovely to meet you. What was your name?
**DM:** My name's
**DM:** Cedany Stoneswar.
**Ash-Arva:** Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Sydney. Enjoy your evening.
**DM:** And you see the old man walk up to her and go,
**DM:** You join me for the rat races tomorrow? I have a bet on the big one.
**DM:** You're still doing those blasted rat races?
**Ash-Arva:** I think Ash kind of walks inside at this point, like, into the memoriam itself to talk to my superiors.
**DM:** Yeah. And at this point, Ruddy, you wake up.
**DM:** You wake up somehow in your bed, Ruddy, completely unaware of what happened in your head, budger. Do you still hear those whispers, both of you?
**Ash-Arva:** I every so often, I look at Steve and go, you're saying something, mate?
**DM:** Gives no response.
**Ruddy:** Sorry. I I'm there. I thought I was still asleep.
**DM:** Yeah. I said you're you're waking up.
**Ash-Arva:** No. No. You you've you've woken up. You're not with me. Just said we were doing
**Ruddy:** I sort of wake up and, and, like, wander around the town aimlessly, probably playing music.
**Ruddy:** Practicing practicing my songs.
**DM:** Where in the town specifically?
**Ruddy:** I feel like hold on.
**DM:** I can re me reply to court posting that.
**Ruddy:** Where would I have started out?
**DM:** So you would have started out at you would have started out at number three.
**Ruddy:** Okay, number three, let me find it on the map. Give me a second. Where is it found everything else? But three.
**Ruddy:** Okay. I found it. I probably would have wandered up somewhere by the crystals.
**Ruddy:** And I'm like just playing a little bit in the, in the center of the town, just kind of wandering around.
**DM:** Make a perception check.
**DM:** A disadvantage.
**Ruddy:** 14.
**DM:** The shadows seem to be moving.
**Ruddy:** That's unnerving.
**DM:** So you just play music. Is that what you wanna do for the day or for the morning?
**Ruddy:** The morning, yes, but I sort of like try to, like, what's the word, inconspicuously get away from the shadows.
**DM:** Симски Февалония
**Ruddy:** I do not like that.
**DM:** Right now, it would be about eight in the morning. And around this time, Theoden and Vera, you would both be awake.
**DM:** Would still see
**DM:** You're good. Cort has an upset stomach. The upset stomach.
**DM:** Yeah. And and you're the one who wakes up first so I can give armory time.
**DM:** You wake up, and there's a note beside your bed.
**DM:** Follow the stars in your chase.
**Theodin:** Grab a cup of coffee and probably go to the,
**DM:** There wouldn't be a library, but you would head towards the Wise 1.
**DM:** She knows everything about everywhere. As you walk up, you'll see this very old lady.
**DM:** And she looks at you and goes,
**Theodin:** Bucks, honestly.
**Theodin:** Already read through them all, the ones that I have.
**DM:** History? I have a lot of books on history, darling.
**Theodin:** Then all of the above.
**DM:** And you see, she guides you into her house. The house is very small. It's on the edge of town surrounded by trees. It's on the inside, it's way bigger. It it you don't know how this big of a space fits in such a small pot.
**DM:** You see rows and rows of books. And you see a kobold a familiar kobold sitting at a table eating breakfast, and she just smiles and points to Runga's. Over there.
**DM:** Roll a d 20.
**Theodin:** Alright. Oh, cut. God, I hate my butter fingers.
**Theodin:** Five
**DM:** You find two books about
**DM:** The history of the invisible archer.
**DM:** A myth that he's been hunting for a while.
**DM:** These books seem to be annotated in in the margins.
**Theodin:** Oh, I've been looking for the Smith on this invisible Archer for the past thirty or so years. It's on among my list of interests.
**DM:** See the cobalt stiffen that they quickly eat as food or run upstairs?
**Theodin:** This is a common interaction that he's used to at this point. Oh, no. Spooky knowledge. Somebody runs away. Yep.
**DM:** You gonna read there for the morning? Read the books. Alright. And then, Sarah, you're waking at about eight in the morning as well.
**DM:** Would you like to do?
**DM:** Okay. Walter is still handling that.
**DM:** Yeah. You're you're good.
**Theodin:** I I hear the I hear the Skyrim music. That's amazing.
**DM:** You both hear Ruddy and Darren. You and Ash if Ash is listening. And Vera, all of you basically hear at the same time.
**DM:** Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.
**Ash-Arva:** Was that, Steve? Tomorrow? Sorry. Say that again. You I won't quite unmute you. What was that, Steve? Tomorrow?
**DM:** Hear no response from Steve.
**Ash-Arva:** One of these days, I'm sure you're going to speak to me.
**DM:** As you awaken to a rat sitting on your chest,
**Ash-Arva:** I'm awake and in the graveyard.
**DM:** Not Ash. Not Ash. Vera.
**Vera:** Oh, okay.
**DM:** Rat is just staring at you.
**Vera:** Verajust sighs and goes, well, this is the weirdest date I've woken up to in the morning. What do you want?
**DM:** Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. And the wreck disappears.
**Vera:** The rat disappears is what they said.
**Vera:** Did the rats say sorry?
**DM:** The rat said tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow and then disappeared in a puff of like red
**Vera:** Tomorrow,
**Vera:**Six years running.
**DM:** Would you like to spend your day or your morning?
**Ash-Arva:** paperwork for William again.
**Vera:** For work for Willie.
**Theodin:** Also, I need to reiterate something. Not 380 years old. 340.
**DM:** Paperwork for William.
**DM:** Okay. So the morning passes into lunchtime. Would you and in the afternoon, would you or like to do anything? Talk to any of those people, go shopping.
**Ash-Arva:** Ash would Ash would probably go to the marketplace, actually.
**Ash-Arva:** Look at the local market
**Ash-Arva:** Was Yeah. I think that's what the show for them.
**Theodin:** Hello, traveler. Kajita's.
**DM:** What would you like to do?
**Ruddy:** Ruddy would just be like, Ruddy would just be like wandering around the town trying to get away from the shadows playing music. And, he just looks like an idiot, but he, at this point, he's sort of like broken out into like a sprint.
**Ash-Arva:** A gallop, if you would.
**DM:** Ash, make a perception check as Ruddy passes here.
**Ruddy:** He's playing a song he's writing about the weird shadows.
**DM:** You see nothing. You just see you just see Ruddy running by. The Steve seems to be acting different.
**Ash-Arva:** I think I would have actually left Steve at the graveyard.
**Ash-Arva:** Generally, he only accompanies me when I'm planning on getting shit faced or planning on doing something dangerous.
**DM:** Yeah okay so there are a couple of shops. There is a Naga who seems to be selling like stuff from
**DM:** Stuff from the water?
**Ash-Arva:** Not interested. Next.
**DM:** There is a deer centaur who
**DM:** Has very random things. Like, there's no need to that.
**Ash-Arva:** Is the center pretty?
**DM:** I can show you a picture because I I personally would say she's white bread.
**Ash-Arva:** I woke up to that stand.
**DM:** She looks to you and goes, oh, hello. My first customer.
**Ash-Arva:** Am Ash-Arva of the House of Blood. Pleasure to meet you.
**DM:** She seems to stiffen a little bit and then shakes her head and goes, oh I have been never mind, what can I get you? And you see on her table she just has sticks.
**DM:** Of different colors. One of them seems to be from the Life Tree itself.
**Ash-Arva:** How much for the points of a random stick random colored stick?
**DM:** Oh that one that one that one's from a place I shouldn't have gone. It is,
**DM:** Don't know. You're my first customer ever. No one likes my sticks.
**Ash-Arva:** How much for all your sticks?
**Ash-Arva:** Yes. 10.
**Ash-Arva:** Do I make it fifteen and you come sit there later?
**DM:** You see red blush all over her face and she drops the stuff she's been using and does she looks behind her and goes okay.
**Ash-Arva:** You do not have to, darling, if you don't want to. It's just an offer.
**DM:** no. I I I wouldn't mind.
**DM:** She Would like to talk about the that then she points to the symbol of the godfather or the gravefather.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, of course. I've always I'm always happy to talk about him.
**DM:** You heard about tonight or tomorrow?
**Ash-Arva:** The rat races, I believe.
**DM:** Yeah. The rat race. That's what I meant. You don't hear the whispers.
**Ash-Arva:** I hear the whispers. I just assumed they were one of my friends playing a joke on me. They do this sometimes when they're bored. Looks looks like a shadowy corner as if I was expecting to see something pop out of it at any moment.
**DM:** See a middle finger.
**Ash-Arva:** Uh-huh. But yeah.
**DM:** And, Ruddy, at that moment, the shadow chasing you disappears.
**Ruddy:** Getting a little bit tired from sprinting.
**Ash-Arva:** And, should I add a collection of random sticks to my bag?
**DM:** Yes. Note that one is from the Life Tree.
**Ash-Arva:** I leave that I actually leave that one on the table.
**DM:** Okay. And then one of them is from the godless realm.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, I look at that one. I look up at them go.
**Ash-Arva:** Nadol where you were supposed to go. Yes.
**DM:** Yeah. I said that. I said that. Oh, no. I said that. Please ignore that you heard that.
**Ash-Arva:** You're aware that's illegal. Right?
**DM:** I didn't mean to go there, I got lost.
**DM:** The Seas tended to drag me away.
**Ash-Arva:** Did you see anything there?
**DM:** Don't know. I don't really remember. I just remember seeing really sleepy lizard.
**Ash-Arva:** K. They're doing that job.
**DM:** Talked to a sleepy lizard, and he gave me it. Said that I would need it one day. Yeah.
**Ash-Arva:** He gave you it, then you should keep it.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, well, thank you.
**DM:** That someone would come around for it.
**Ash-Arva:** Well, this stick is interesting. Also Don't go there again. Ashish is not going to cover it up.
**DM:** No promises. The seas have a mind of their own.
**Ash-Arva:** If you go there again, if you meet anyone
**Ash-Arva:** Tell them you're a friend of the house of blood and give them my name.
**Ash-Arva:** That should probably stop you being executed on the bot.
**DM:** That's mildly concerning.
**Ash-Arva:** Don't worry about it.
**DM:** Executions haven't gone on for
**Ash-Arva:** Don't worry about it.
**DM:** She counts on her hand, and, like, she loses count after five and goes, no. Dang it. And two. A long time.
**Ash-Arva:** Don't worry about it. I will see you at dinner. Yeah?
**Ash-Arva:** Give a little wave and walk off. I go straight back to the graveyard, and I report this to my superiors immediately, but stress to them that it's being handled.
**DM:** As you reported, there seems to be something interfering.
**Ash-Arva:** Like, to the free people who are there.
**DM:** It's those people. Yeah. That they that
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. No. No. Not my superior superiors, but my immediate.
**DM:** Yeah. They just Luanda flick you and go, oh, that one, don't worry about her. She
**DM:** No worries.
**Ash-Arva:** Beggold and Scaly.
**Ash-Arva:** I say their actual name as a note. I do not say big old and scaly, but
**DM:** We'll keep an eye on her. Don't worry.
**Ash-Arva:** Here it's now. I have dinner to go prepared to have.
**Ash-Arva:** I will be unavailable for the rest of the day. Send Steve to find me if you need me. Toodle.
**DM:** You see Steve just following you automatically?
**Ash-Arva:** Steve, stay here. If they need me, come find me.
**DM:** He just gives a nod.
**Ash-Arva:** I just I will go and do things. I am 100% watching the shadows now because I am almost convinced that there is a House of Shades person following me and plaguing up the joke on me.
**DM:** Yeah. Don't worry.
**DM:** Alright. Farrah, thinning, fruity, what would you like to do?
**Ash-Arva:** Go further next.
**DM:** Vera the rest of the day.
**Theodin:** I have no idea.
**DM:** Would you have to just continue reading?
**Theodin:** Yeah. But, more history books.
**DM:** Yeah. Roll another roll a history check this time.
**DM:** With Advantage because you're used to the library.
**Theodin:** 22.
**DM:** You find books.
**DM:** In a section that you don't think should have. They're about
**DM:** About the life tree itself
**DM:** About the early years of its existence.
**DM:** As you open the book,
**Theodin:** And he would say to himself, nothing ventured, nothing gained.
**DM:** You see six paths in front of you.
**DM:** One griddled with stars,
**DM:** One of flame,
**DM:** One of the autumn sun. And I don't know how to explain it other than, like, a good autumn sunset is what that happens.
**DM:** And one riddled in darkness.
**DM:** As you open this book, that's what's laid out in front of you. It takes over your entire mission as you unconsciously.
**DM:** You see that those paths came from one
**DM:** They came from a single point.
**DM:** Federal.
**DM:** Etti towards that point.
**DM:** You feel the book slam.
**DM:** And then you're jolted back, and you see the cobalt flaring at you and going, don't open that.
**DM:** The order will see you.
**DM:** There's very dangerous knowledge in these books. If anyone were to get them, bad things.
**Theodin:** I know much dangerous I know much dangerous knowledge.
**DM:** This is knowledge that no one should have.
**DM:** Only allowed to be had because she created the knowledge.
**DM:** You hear the stars?
**Theodin:** What?
**DM:** You hear the stars?
**Theodin:** No. I do not hear anything.
**DM:** And he just walks back upstairs.
**Theodin:** And then would then go take a couple of books and go find somewhere more private to read like he usually does.
**DM:** Would probably end up
**Theodin:** Like an office or something.
**DM:** Yeah, you'd probably find yourself, like, by the church, which is number one.
**DM:** And you would see just this you'll just be sitting under a tree and just reading.
**Theodin:** Sorry. Give me a second.
**DM:** Ruddy, what about you? You're okay. K?
**Ruddy:** Feel like Ruddy might like make his way past the, the market trying to like calm himself down and possibly end up near, where Kei's character is.
**Ruddy:** And he would he would wave, as he sees him and goes, Hello, old Rhett? Young? Old? Young? Old Rhett? I'm sorry, your age is kind of an enigma to me.
**Theodin:** I'm I'm I'm here now. I was taking off my fuck body because I'm getting overstimulated. No. You're fine. You're fine.
**Theodin:** Just, like, start back from the beginning, please.
**Ruddy:** Oh, Ruddy would be would wander past the market and sort of make his way, near where your character is. You you said their name was, like, Theatus?
**Theodin:** Theoden. Natty t no. T h e o d e n.
**Theodin:** Yeah. Keep in mind, he has olive skin, bleached blonde hair. He has hazel green eyes and wears thin framed, like, wireframe circle, glasses.
**Ruddy:** He walks up to Theoren and goes, Ah, hello old friend, young friend, old young I'm sorry, your age is a bit of an enigma to me.
**Theodin:** Hello.
**Theodin:** I was doing great since I managed to find someplace secluded that peeping that a peeping Tom wasn't able to bother me while I was reading.
**Ruddy:** He sort of sits down completely missing the point and goes can I sit with you?
**Theodin:** Sure. I read ahead. I was referring I was referring to the kobold after all.
**Ruddy:** Do you read it? It sort of, like, peaks over his shoulder.
**Theodin:** It's another one of my favorite history books. This one is about past battles that have been waged on this continent.
**DM:** Make a history check, Ruddy.
**DM:** As she look over the book,
**DM:** It it's not like the usual textbook that you would see in school. It's of an old legend, but you don't quite remember the
**Ruddy:** I've recognized this one, not very well.
**Theodin:** Hold on. My mouth is full of food.
**Ruddy:** We got minus two.
**DM:** All the chomp chomps.
**Ruddy:** Sorry. We're eating chicken.
**Theodin:** Yes. It was about the battle of of Antiques.
**Theodin:** Back when the back when those humans were on their crusade following their king following their king James, they were leading a crusade against this one kingdom, and they were ultimately thwarted, fortunately, because the city of Antiquities had
**Theodin:** Etti much mastered their their craft and magic, and had successfully managed to integrate them into their main forces.
**Theodin:** In fact, it was almost like every single one of even their most basic of foot soldiers knew how to cast something even as simple as fireball.
**Ruddy:** Sort of, like, he's sitting next to you, and he has his hooves out in front of him, and he's just, like, happily tapping them to, like, a rhythm. And he goes, I might wanna write a song about this.
**Ruddy:** Have you noticed the shadows?
**Theodin:** The one that always follows me whenever the sun is out? Yes.
**Ruddy:** Oh, thank god. I'm not the only one.
**DM:** Sofia make a perception check.
**Ruddy:** Oh, 12.
**DM:** Yes. Both of you.
**Theodin:** Kumi? Oh, okay.
**Theodin:** Oh, wait a minute. Perception. No. That would be 17.
**Ash-Arva:** Six to 17. Great upgrade.
**Ash-Arva:** My minus one minus one to a plus 10.
**Theodin:** Plus a plus wait. No. It would be no. It would be a no. It would be a 16. I have a plus 10.
**Theodin:** My arcana is a plus 11.
**DM:** Jen, what did you get for perception?
**DM:** Okay. They did. You you notice there seems to be something moving with the shadows underneath as the sun's high in this bag. Shadows are moving in ways they should.
**Ruddy:** Sort of pulls out his instrument and goes I wrote a song about it, I call this one I don't like this
**Ruddy:** Yeah. Basically.
**Ash-Arva:** I don't like this. I don't like this. I really don't like this. The shadows are moving. What the fuck? If you don't know a song called I don't like this, it would just be I don't like this. Start screaming. I'm sorry.
**Ruddy:** I don't like this. Ah! Frantic strumming.
**Theodin:** Do do do do do do do do. Look. I was like, I don't like this.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah.
**DM:** So we're gonna leave this here and it's going we're all gonna go to bed because this is funny and all that there's a lot of other shit that needs to happen.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. Quite
**Ruddy:** Okay. Okay. I just spend the rest of the day annoying Faye Hiddin.
**Theodin:** I promise. I am I I promise. I'm trying to do my best to come up with random bullshit.
**DM:** No. You're good. I appreciate it.
**Ruddy:** I'm just gonna say that Ruddy spends the rest of the day annoying the hell out of Theoden.
**Ash-Arva:** Do I end up with this centaur in my bed?
**Ash-Arva:** Success.
**DM:** I don't know how you're gonna do it.
**Ruddy:** Me in your bed? Real quick. Just kidding. One centhar.
**Ash-Arva:** But we're gonna do drug center now.
**Theodin:** No. The other no. The other centaur girl.
**Ruddy:** Man can have dreams, okay?
**DM:** So as night falls,
**DM:** Everyone here falls into a deep sleep.
**DM:** I gotta find my notes to this.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, things are happening.
**DM:** As everyone sleeps, we're gonna start with theanum first.
**DM:** Usually, your dreams are just filled with random nonsense from the day, from the books you've read to you remembering information. You've you've gained a level of control over your so this feels like it's out of your control.
**DM:** You see in front of you the night sky. Seems the night sky is just surrounding you.
**DM:** Stars seem to be falling left and right.
**DM:** You look down, there's nothing.
**Theodin:** Just in a void.
**Theodin:** Hey. What's up, my brother?
**DM:** And yes, you see this one star fall directly in front of you. You see a child shrouded in like coming off of them is this yellow mist. They have black skin, long braided hair. Can't quite tell their check.
**DM:** About six years old.
**DM:** They have flowers. They have
**DM:** To think of they have cherry blossoms in their hair.
**Theodin:** Alright.
**DM:** It seems to be growing, and the child just looks at you until it's its head. He goes, you seem lost. This is my home. Where are you supposed to be?
**Theodin:** I'm, I don't know. I'm supposed to be asleep. I suppose I am. This isn't usually the dream I have.
**Theodin:** Usually, I have more control over these things.
**DM:** This might be must be quite scary to be in a place you don't know.
**Theodin:** Not scary. Intriguing. This is a chance for me to learn.
**DM:** Need help. Do you wanna help me?
**Theodin:** And pray tell, what is it that you need help with?
**DM:** Something's gonna happen soon that's unavoidable.
**DM:** I need you to find who doesn't.
**DM:** Critted this time.
**Theodin:** This timeline,
**DM:** Yes. This timeline.
**Theodin:** Okay. I'm gonna max out your I'm I already have you, like, high up there, but I'm gonna max you out.
**DM:** Yeah. This child just says,
**DM:** Yeah. I I am
**Ash-Arva:** Might need to speak up a tiny bit, Rainbow. A couple of things you speak softly. The the things you speak softly are catching.
**Theodin:** Yeah. I think it I think the mic the yeah. And the microphone, yeah, the microphone cuts out right at the end of your words.
**DM:** Because I'm speaking normal volume on my end. That's weird. Hold on.
**DM:** Let me turn down my sensitivity because
**DM:** So
**Theodin:** Either that or just turn up the sensitivity because I have the gain pretty high, so it's able to pick up a lot of stuff. That and turning off noise suppression helps.
**DM:** Yeah. So you hear this child kind of look at you and go, there's something that's gonna happen that I can't stop.
**DM:** It needs to happen, but I need to know who and why.
**Theodin:** Real. And I'm assuming this is important to you.
**DM:** Yes, they're upending the piece that I worked for.
**DM:** They are upending the peace that we all live in today.
**Theodin:** And you don't know who this is that is responsible?
**DM:** They're out of my sight.
**DM:** They're out of the stars.
**Theodin:** Out of your sight. Who are who are you?
**DM:** Child reaches out her hand and goes, I can't tell you unless you take my hand.
**Theodin:** Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. And you would stick out his hand.
**DM:** We're gonna take pause there and we're gonna go to Vera next, if that's okay with Yhort And Armory.
**DM:** Hi. So, Vera, as you sleep,
**DM:** As you fall into a sleep, you notice your dream shifts way too much to be normal. It's going from this very grassy windy plain. Hold on. It is way too hot for my van to be off. You it goes from this windy plain to
**Ash-Arva:** You might need to turn your sensitivity back up and just talk a bit louder then.
**DM:** I am talking very loudly, though.
**DM:** Hold on.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, that's just fine. Leave it on. Leave it on. We could just ask you to repeat a couple of words if you need to.
**DM:** Let me turn off noise suppression. How's that? Okay. Okay. How is this?
**DM:** Okay. Cool. This is on Chrisp.
**DM:** So, Vera, you see this windy plain at first. You're surrounded by flowers of multiple varieties. The sky seems to be just perfect. Feels very nice, then it quickly shifts to this never ending fire. This blaze around you, this heat that's overbearing.
**DM:** But then the fire starts to freeze, and it cracks.
**DM:** You're surrounded by this black ice.
**DM:** You hear whispers all around you saying, help. It hurts. Shut up. Get away from her. Help me. Help me.
**DM:** And then you see a child standing in front of you, and these whispers start to quiet. This child's form, you can't quite pick out what they look like. All you can see is the color red.
**DM:** A child looks at you and goes, someone's gonna do something bad to me. You need to fix it.
**DM:** In another voice, your prom.
**DM:** Need to save her.
**DM:** And then it goes back to the first voice and goes, shut up, unless you want me to push more of the fire away.
**Vera:** No. No. Stop bickering. Tell me what's going on. I can't help if I don't know now, can I?
**DM:** Make a perception check.
**DM:** With advantage because of where you're from.
**Vera:** 26.
**DM:** You notice in this you notice immediately that this red aura turns to ice. But inside the ice
**DM:** It's a small child whose flames seems to be burning out.
**DM:** And you hear a whisper in your head.
**DM:** Going. You need to find who doesn't.
**DM:** You need to find who does it.
**Vera:**  Find who does what?
**DM:** They can't tell you that. You will have to see.
**DM:** Fate is fickle. If we tell you now, fate will be unwound, and the voice is immediately cut off.
**Vera:**  Well, well, aren't we in a predicament?
**DM:** The ice turns back to fire, but you still notice that it's still supposed to be ice and goes, will you help me?
**DM:** You help me fix it?
**Vera:** I will certainly try child of head and ice.
**DM:** You see?
**DM:** The area behind you shatter.
**DM:** All around you, the frozen fire shatters, and there's nothing. And the child just holds out its hand, a smile you can't quite you can't quite understand and goes take my hand.
**DM:** We will do great things.
**DM:** Will fix this world.
**Vera:** There anything off about that that I can sense?
**DM:** Inside investigation.
**DM:** Or religion.
**Vera:** That will be insight then because that's the plus eight one.
**DM:** Insight?
**DM:** You notice that there's
**DM:** A slight twist to what they're wanting. There is something else at play.
**DM:** It's not all just about
**DM:** This child.
**Vera:**  So Vera reaches out, pauses.
**Vera:** Squints a little and retracts her hand, but almost immediately as she does so shakes her head and
**Vera:**  Clasps the child's hand firmly.
**DM:** Then we're pausing there for you as well.
**DM:** We're going to Ash next.
**Ash-Arva:** Delightful.
**DM:** Ash, you were asleep. You fell asleep in the bed of this young centaur who seems to be just passed out cuddling up to you. Very peaceful. Asleep.
**DM:** As you fall asleep,
**DM:** You're back in a familiar place. You're back at home.
**DM:** Online, your house isn't there.
**Ash-Arva:** That's concerning.
**DM:** It's like none of it ever existed. And out of as you look around, do you see where there's burned roots? The roots are alive, and they're flowing with magic that you can visibly see.
**DM:** As you look in the sky, you see many, many dragons.
**DM:** One you are familiar with, like, but at a very young age.
**Ash-Arva:** So probably probably not with the correct number of heads then.
**DM:** Yes. Circling circling above you and then in front of you as you look back down.
**DM:** See how Vera simple looking.
**DM:** But as you try to look closer to it, it seems like a shadow covers it.
**Ash-Arva:** I I walked towards the house and tried to knock on the door.
**DM:** You go to knock on the door, the door opens. And you just hear Come in. Come in. Come in.
**Ash-Arva:** Thank thank you for the invitation. I should step step through the doorway.
**DM:** Not supposed to be here.
**Ash-Arva:** No. There are too many winged lizards with uppy intentions for my day.
**DM:** The house starts to shake. Don't mess with my pets.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, your pets. Apologies. And I know that one and, like, points outside to where I assume they are still circling. And I know that one. It takes great pleasure in messing with me.
**DM:** It's my familiar.
**Ash-Arva:** Hello, boss.
**DM:** The child smiles. He goes,
**DM:** I'm not lost.
**Ash-Arva:** No. No. I don't believe you're capable of it. That requires some level of incompetence that I just do not believe you have.
**DM:** Child starts to chuckle and goes, something bad is going to happen.
**Ash-Arva:** Can I get out of doing whatever it is you want me to do?
**DM:** There's a sigh in those.
**DM:** For the sake of the timeline, no.
**DM:** Unless you want to deal with then he cuts himself off looking around as if in fear.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, I'm assuming the spooky tree can hear at least you.
**DM:** Hold on. He holds up a hand, and with a wave of his hand, I do notice
**DM:** Around you, you're still in the house, but you notice the outside, you're no longer back home. You're in a different place altogether, a place you don't know, but the tree is not there. Any size and goes.
**DM:** He sighs and goes.
**DM:** When what happens happens, you need to see the one who did.
**Ash-Arva:** Elimination, extraction, interrogation.
**DM:** Whatever it takes to stop the ritual he's planning.
**Ash-Arva:** Elimination. Got it, boss.
**Ash-Arva:** Know that's my fault.
**Ash-Arva:** Probably.
**DM:** Closes his eyes and almost whispers to himself. You can hear an echo in the house. I'm going to regret saying Then he looks he opens his eyes and looks at you and goes, I am not allowed to leave because of the people that person is working.
**DM:** I cannot leave this house. That is why I am gone.
**Ash-Arva:** They were trying to you. I assume. Uh-huh.
**DM:** They found and they burned my house.
**Ash-Arva:** Well, that is a problem. I will inform
**Ash-Arva:** A few people love this.
**DM:** Don't look towards the noble.
**DM:** Några är min sönerna.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. Now I am going to pretend I am not talking to my god.
**Ash-Arva:** And I am going to walk out of this house.
**DM:** Before you Do the child disappears and reappears in front of you and holds out his hand. I need you to just take my hand.
**DM:** I'll let you ride one of my dragons in this industry.
**DM:** And we're pausing there as you take his hand. And, Ruddy, as you fall asleep.
**Ash-Arva:** Gonna mute for a sec because I need to go piss.
**DM:** You're good, darling. Pretty. Your
**Ruddy:** Go piss piss person.
**DM:** You're surrounded in a Savannah plant. Farms all around you. Farms that don't there's plants that shouldn't naturally be growing, but they are.
**DM:** It seems like it's always a nice autumn sunset here.
**DM:** There is no wind, no heat. It is always the perfect temperature.
**Ruddy:** This feels like a lovely place to run.
**DM:** Notice in front of you that there is this
**DM:** Almost, like, erased out of existence. Vera child covered with dark brown hair, blue overalls, white shirt that's covered in dirt in my arm. Rolled up sleeves, running up. She goes, hi. Welcome to the farm. Wanna help me?
**Ruddy:** Oh, hello there. Yeah, sure. What do you need help with?
**DM:** Looks towards the farm that seems to be. You know when you, like, have a drawing on a piece of paper and you start to erase it, you can see the faint memory?
**DM:** The farm is starting to fade like that. As if someone's slowly erasing it, and he just goes, someone's erasing us.
**Ruddy:** Oh, well, that's not good. How do I help?
**DM:** I need you to stop them from bringing back the people we tried to stop.
**DM:** Maple crystal saver.
**Ruddy:** It is a 12. Not very good. I have a plus zero in wisdom.
**DM:** That's fine. That's what I needed.
**DM:** So, a child looks at you, you see a flash of these stone juts, hands reaching out of the ground, a red circle surrounded by bodies.
**DM:** You need to stop them.
**Ruddy:** I will. This is no good.
**Ruddy:** Why would they do this?
**DM:** Child looks like he wants to say something, but he's looking around in fear.
**Ruddy:** Sort of like kneels down to get on the child's level, but it's a little hard because he's kind of tall. And he looks the child in the eyes, and like places his hands gently on the child's cheeks and goes, It's okay. I- You're safe here. I'm here.
**DM:** Nor never safe.
**DM:** Now with people bringing back the ones that we wanted to forget. Michelle reaches out his hand and goes, I can help guide you. You have to take my hand.
**Ruddy:** He like reluctantly, but then, takes the child's hand and goes, whatever it takes, I can help you.
**DM:** And I think court is still in the bathroom, so we wanna take a quick five minutes.
**Ruddy:** Because I gotta go pee.
**Ash-Arva:** Douglas? Douglas.
**DM:** I mentally need five minutes.
**Ruddy:** Okay. All good. All good.
**Theodin:** Yeah. Court, they all just went.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. No worries.
**DM:** Because we're about to get to the juicy shed.
**DM:** By the way, if you guys want to do the rat races, let me know.
**Ash-Arva:** Not right now. I think we should get on with the stuff.
**DM:** I'm trying.
**Ash-Arva:** Doing you're doing really good. Yeah. You're doing absolutely amazing.
**Ruddy:** Doing great. I'm very much enjoying this.
**Ash-Arva:** Doing great, and it's really good. It's it's never going it's your DMing style is very different to
**Ash-Arva:** My DMing style can use work, quite honestly, in a couple of areas.
**Theodin:** I'm I'm just trying to figure out what's I'm just trying to figure out what's going on because I'm a little bit more oblivious than most.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. It will don't worry. It will all become clear. This bit was meant to be a bit from what I know.
**DM:** Yeah. This is supposed to be a big deal.
**Ruddy:** Okay.
**DM:** Just remember what the people said to you, and I have it written down if you need me to tell you what they said.
**Ruddy:** Appreciate that.
**Ash-Arva:** Hey. Well I know what they said to me. I know exactly what that thing was.
**DM:** Yes. You.
**Ash-Arva:** Uh-huh. It helps it helps when I made the continent I came from.
**DM:** Chandelopes.
**Ash-Arva:** It's it's kind of like an entire continent of undead Brian's, Jen.
**Ruddy:** Yeah. I know you told me. I love that I love that continent.
**Ash-Arva:** Like, entire continent of undead Brian's, like, morally.
**Ruddy:** Okay. I go pee now.
**DM:** Yeah.
**Ruddy:** Thought I'm thirsty.
**Ash-Arva:** I'm gonna mute for a sec and just test them for a minute.
**Theodin:** What's up? Join the music. Join the music or you're enjoying the music? Okay.
**DM:** Music is supposed to be like this nice ambidecron noise.
**Theodin:** Hell hell, rainbow. I said it's lovely. Did you hear that?
**DM:** Yeah. I did.
**Theodin:** You alright?
**Ash-Arva:** Rainbow, you're doing amazing.
**DM:** I'm trying.
**DM:** It feel to be a player?
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. Great. Honestly, I cannot meet to be more of a I cannot wait to be more of a whole.
**Ash-Arva:** We taking bets on how long it takes Ash to try and fuck better? Yeah. Doesn't matter if Ash is tight actually. No better his breathing. Doesn't matter if Ash is tight.
**DM:** Should I expect the Centaur to wake up with a bite?
**Theodin:** That's all over your body.
**Ash-Arva:** No. Very specifically, no. She's under she's under very strict orders. She well, no. A lot of bite marks, but not that sort of bite. She's under very strict orders to no longer bite people on other continents.
**Theodin:** Lots of hickeys, lots of lipstick.
**Theodin:** Lots of tormenting.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. Yep. Oh, yeah. Like this deep, almost, like, pitch black red. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
**Ruddy:** Can bite me, Lou.
**Ruddy:** Wisata.
**DM:** Alright. Are we all ready?
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, she's planning on it. Don't worry. Like, it's so black, Auburn almost. Yes. It's it's not the deep red, almost black. Yep. We're all ready. Let me just get into bed properly.
**DM:** Also, posture check at Bremlins Fox.
**Ash-Arva:** At seven four. I'm fine. That's why I'm getting into bed.
**DM:** Oh, god. That reminds me I need to charge my phone.
**DM:** Thank you. My phone was at eighteen.
**DM:** Okay. So
**Ash-Arva:** Welcome. What can I say except you're welcome? 
**Vera:** Maybe do I expect a, like, 03:60 being grumpy notification? No. It's fifteen. It gets grumpy. Oh, okay.
**DM:** So as you all take each child's hand, the child shits. Say it in yours, turns into this very elegant woman. This the fuck is my picture of her? I forgot it.
**DM:** This black skinned woman with black hair that seems to curl in just the most perfect way.
**DM:** You would know her as Thenaris, the mother of all.
**DM:** Vera Next, it's this well, this tiefling that you see for just a split set.
**DM:** You see a woman with porcelain white skin, long flowing white cloak that seems to just always be in the wind.
**DM:** And that's what she looks like.
**Ash-Arva:** K.
**Ash-Arva:** Leave mine as a surprise.
**DM:** Hatch. As you take it, you know exactly what he looks like.
**Ash-Arva:** Uh-huh. He's a bitch. I I think Ash kind of, like, smiles roughly and goes, always with the child gimmick.
**DM:** Ruddy, as you take your child's hand, it grows into this tree ant that is nine foot two.
**DM:** It seems to have this glowing creature that seems to be just glowing all around him.
**DM:** Like, plants just exist around, and he understands them.
**Theodin:** Just press.
**DM:** Before yours can respond, Ash, you're all rudely awoken. It is currently one in the afternoon. You were awoken to screams. You hear you hear a minotaur screaming. She's dead. Where did the killer go?
**DM:** Need everyone to roll initiative, but we're not going into ground combat.
**Ash-Arva:** You have advantage. I think no one else does. 30 feet. Not that far. They didn't like. No.
**Theodin:** I am trying. My phone is being very slow.
**Ash-Arva:** 12 for me. 
**Vera:** 20.
**DM:** Okay. And I just need case whenever his call works.
**Theodin:** 16.
**DM:** Sixteen? Okay. So as you all awaken one by one, Vera, you go first, you're Elkini to hearing your mercenary, your guardsmen screaming, she's dead. Get the sheriff.
**Vera:**  So Vera would almost immediately bolt out of bed and, like,
**Vera:**  Like, grab, like, all of her, stuff.
**DM:** Yep. You can easily put it on.
**Vera:**  Yeah. And then, like, start making a fucking beeline doubt. I'm assuming it's like, I'm assuming it's like the holding cells are downstairs and, like, the
**Vera:**  11 quarters are upstairs.
**DM:** Yeah. You would hear the screaming coming from outside in the town square.
**Vera:**  Actually, is there a window open?
**Vera:**  Acrobatics?
**DM:** Sure.
**DM:** Acrobatics.
**Vera:**   Is that true?
**DM:** Easily make it down.
**Vera:**  And I start running.
**DM:** There's probably, like, a pile of hay right outside your window that's been there because you do this quite a lot.
**Ash-Arva:** It's been put there on purpose. You'd there's a pile of hay under your window. Assassin's Creed style pile of hay. Yeah.
**DM:** Basically, assassins create that shit. Yeah. Okay. So you managed to make it out, and then we're going to Theoden. You are staying in the sheriff's house as well, and you're awoken to screaming of she's dead. She's dead from this loud, booming voice.
**DM:** You hear a thud as there's hay rustling in. You would know by now that is the sound of her absolutely jumping out of her window.
**Theodin:** Alright. Guess I'm going outside too.
**Theodin:** See what all this damn commotion is.
**DM:** Seems to be a lot of screening.
**DM:** So you make it out of the house as well. Next, we have ash here in the inn.
**Ash-Arva:** Ash Ash is completely naked, like like, pulls open the door, looks down, quickly runs back in, gets dressed, and kind of just it's like second am I on the Second Floor?
**DM:** Yes. Right outside your door, Steve is holding your book.
**Ash-Arva:** I
**Ash-Arva:** I put I put the clothes. I grab specifically, my blade.
**Ash-Arva:** I grab one of my I grab my hip flask. It I refilled it before I went to bed. I leave the sleeping woman.
**DM:** When they stand,
**DM:** Acrobatics.
**Ash-Arva:** And I I I think Ash takes an extra, like, couple of seconds to scribble a note of Screaming in the Town. I'm going to check it out. Dinner, question mark. Why are you like this? And then runs outside, probably, like, wall kicking a couple of times to get downstairs slightly faster. I have a climbing speed. Thank you very much.
**DM:** You're wall jumping. You are not wall climbing.
**Ash-Arva:** Sorry, I would like to run across the wall, please and thank you.
**DM:** Fine. That matters.
**Ash-Arva:** I am not I am not risking tripping up in these heels.
**DM:** Oh, no. If you rolled that, I was gonna have the heels snapped.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. No, thank you. I like my heels.
**DM:** Alright. The next Ruddy, you're welcome. You're in the tavern, and you hear the screaming as well.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy would immediately, like, run out of the tavern and look around to see if he sees anything happening.
**DM:** Hear the screaming coming from outside and at this moment, you see Ash running across the wall fucking Spiderman style.
**Ruddy:** Wow. Acrobatic.
**Ash-Arva:** And, like, jump almost like almost like jumps over you as you get to the door to get out slightly before you.
**Ruddy:** He looks up and goes, Aye, do you know what's going on?
**Ash-Arva:** Nope. Gonna find out. Mind if I hop on? You seem faster than me.
**Ruddy:** Okay. He just sort of like blushes and then like leans down so you can jump on his back.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, she 100% very much pushes herself against the back of Ruddy. Vera gets as close to him as possible.
**Ruddy:** He just goes, oh, he just goes, oh.
**DM:** Freddie, what do you smell like?
**Ruddy:** I feel like he would smell like sandalwood. He'd he takes care of himself.
**DM:** What you smell when you get close to the mesh.
**DM:** It's the tuition saving there for me.
**Ash-Arva:** Constitution.
**Ash-Arva:** Have had a drink this morning.
**Ash-Arva:** That's only an 11, though.
**DM:** As you all get into the middle of town. Yeah. That's
**Ruddy:** He's he's trying he's trying to be normal. He's trying to be normal about women on his back.
**DM:** You're more focused on the situation at hand, so it was pretty low.
**Ash-Arva:** Mhmm.
**DM:** You all get into the middle of town. You see this dwarf with black hair holding this cobalt by the scruff eyed, like, his collar up in the air and says, what the fuck did you do to the wise dirty dragon?
**Ash-Arva:** Oy. You, little dwarf, kindly unhand him. Everyone deserves their freedom without a bit of manhandling.
**DM:** Everyone arrives, by the way. I'm saying everyone.
**Theodin:** I'd like to rule out that Kobalt first now. That seems to have a little squirt. Sorry. I've already been giving you the creep.
**DM:** Ash. Roll another constitution. Constitution saving. There are disadvantage.
**Ash-Arva:** Disadvantage?
**Ash-Arva:** How's a 21 at disadvantage?
**DM:** At disadvantage, you are fine, but you notice the smell in the air.
**Ash-Arva:** Can I, use BloodSense?
**Ash-Arva:** I am I am aware of everyone with a heartbeat within a 20 feet of me, including invisible fox.
**DM:** All you you see, everyone in town, no one else. But on the floor.
**Ash-Arva:** Where is the smell where is the smell coming from?
**DM:** As you all get to the center of town,
**DM:** You see the headless body of Yania? Otherwise
**DM:** And the kobold having blood on his hands is sobbing, begging Ferger to wake up.
**Ash-Arva:** Is this dwarf still holding this kobold?
**Ash-Arva:** Ash with
**DM:** The Minotaur seems to be looking the other way.
**Ash-Arva:** Ash would hop off, Ruddy, and walk up to this Minotaur. I'm just sorry. This dwarf just go please unhand him. One, that is a child. Two, he is clearly distressed. And three, you seem a bit too prejudicial, is the word probably. Little Earthkin.
**DM:** Is everyone else doing as Ash is doing this?
**Ash-Arva:** New challenger sets up to the fray.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy is just kind of standing there in shock about what happened to her name was Yania. Right?
**DM:** Yeah. I mean, otherwise.
**Ruddy:** My shirts, but there's these swatches on all of them now. No.
**Theodin:** I'm just kind of standing there.
**Ruddy:** About what happened to Yania. He's sort of like holding his hands together and looking at the kobold with concern.
**Ash-Arva:** Vera upon seeing what Ash is responding to.
**Ash-Arva:** Her gaze almost like like, her eyes narrow.
**Ruddy:** I will find a way for them to pay me. If they don't, there will be hell to pay. Okay.
**Ash-Arva:** She very wordlessly walks up to the situation and just goes, hey put him down right now or you will be spending a night in the cell with William. Do I make myself clear?
**DM:** The dwarf looks at both of you, just grumbles and puts the kid down, crosses her arms, and says this kid was near her when she died.
**Ash-Arva:** Your point being anybody could have been near her. For all you know this kid has a personal connection to her. Do not make assumptions without first knowing the knowledge behind why people react the way they do to seeing somebody dead.
**DM:** Yes. Sharon. Yes. Sharon. There say it in. Make a perception, Sharon. For me.
**Theodin:** Yeah. Sorry. I'm here. What? Oh, okay.
**Theodin:** Holy shit. Okay. 29.
**DM:** Notice the dwarf is not happy by putting the cobalt down. Like, she's actively
**Ash-Arva:** Ash is standing there menacingly for a few minutes.
**DM:** So yeah. So
**DM:** So,
**Vera:** I can't see if I need to shit. Court's going to the bathroom again. Sorry. No more food from that place. Up the session check. Right. Okay.
**DM:** You'll notice that also one of the guardsmen is not now.
**DM:** She's not in the town. There are usually three. There are only two right
**Vera:** This including data or no?
**DM:** This is not including Verra.
**Theodin:** Sheriff, we need to get a head Sheriff, we need to get a head count. Someone's missing.
**Vera:** I've noticed. I plan to bring it up with her later.
**Theodin:** Forget it. I don't think they're coming back if my senses are correct.
**DM:** Are you guys gonna do?
**Ruddy:** Ruddy turned to the others and says, do you think that maybe when they've calmed down, we should ask the kobold what happened?
**Theodin:** Take them into custody.
**Ruddy:** Think that might be a bit too much. Maybe protective custody.
**Theodin:** I don't know. Is there life in danger?
**Ash-Arva:** Does the cobbles look hard at all?
**DM:** No one else in the town looks hurt. The kobold is crying over
**DM:** A dead woman's body, just crying for his mother to come back and screaming Nadol again. Not again. I can't lose another family member.
**Ruddy:** Can I approach the Cobalt?
**Ruddy:** He sort of walks up and kneels down next to the kobold and looks at him and goes, You're alright. You're not alone. Can you tell us what happened?
**DM:** Oh, yeah. I guess I can. But one when I was holding your hand when we were listening to Destrian make a speech about how the world was because that's what the festival is here because it's it's the full moon. And and next thing I know, there's blood on my hands, and I looked at I look over and her head's gone, and she's on the floor.
**Ruddy:** There any other witnesses?
**DM:** No. Everyone was focused on the speech. Her head was just gone.
**Ruddy:** He sort of turns to the others and goes I don't think this child is strong enough to decapitate someone.
**DM:** That's my mother.
**Theodin:** They are a kobold after all. They're not known for their feats of strength.
**Ruddy:** Right, this is this child. She was their mother. No child will do that intentionally.
**Ash-Arva:** It's quite hard to do that to someone unintentionally.
**Theodin:** Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Theoden or doctor Einsburn would walk up would walk up to the kobold child. Did you ever know if your mother harbored any enemies or anyone who harbored ill intent towards her?
**DM:** He's the wise man. No one made sure he pauses.
**Theodin:** Try. Think very hard. Try.
**DM:** I've got Vera.
**Theodin:** Think back as far back as you can remember.
**DM:** He's crying, and he pulls out.
**DM:** Out of his pocket.
**DM:** ERC,
**DM:** A ripped page from a book. And
**DM:** Who here knows Celestial?
**Ruddy:** Do, apparently.
**Theodin:** And what is something I can comprehend like?
**Ash-Arva:** I'm almost certain that's a nope. 
**Vera:** Oh, I do, actually. I can read Celestial. I don't know why. 
**Ash-Arva:** No. I can't, actually. Donald enough.
**Ruddy:** I can also read celestial. I also don't know why.
**DM:** Might wanna look at your items, you guys.
**Ruddy:** That's true. Oh, yeah.
**Ash-Arva:** Mine doesn't give me Celeste deal.
**Vera:**  I think mine's
**Vera:**  Oh, yeah. My class gives me celestial.
**Ruddy:** Most mine probably does as well.
**DM:** So for those who Vera celestial, this is poorly written celestial. And it says
**DM:** Va-Tinalus is I'm gonna die, and I know
**DM:** I'm sorry. I can't protect you anymore.
**Ruddy:** When Ruddy sees this, his brow sort of furrows, and he kind of reads it aloud for the rest of them who can't read Celestial.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. That's just notes.
**Theodin:** Any any takers on the lucid dream from last?
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, yes. Terrible. Annoying.
**Theodin:** Judging based on what the dream was like, I could only as one could only assume that this was wider than just the one person.
**Ash-Arva:** Yes. Terrible business. The great father interrupted a great a great dream of mine.
**DM:** You guys would know that the great father is the one who takes care of the bodies once they're dead.
**Ruddy:** You just didn't know that they were associated with him, despite the symbol.
**Ruddy:** He's not very bright. He sort of like puts his hands on the child's shoulder and turns to the others and goes, we need to get this child to safety. If they were after her, they might be after excuse me, this one too.
**Theodin:** Maybe. But at the same time, if they if they were after the mother, the mother was of some pretty high standing, relatively speaking.
**Theodin:** It would seem that it would seem that they were after her because of her status and rather not because it was personal. Otherwise, they would have taken out the child when they had the chance.
**Ash-Arva:** Yes. You're not wrong.
**DM:** Kids looks up at Ashley and goes, yeah.
**Ash-Arva:** Know where the graveyard is.
**DM:** Vera place with the spooky voices.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. Those are my friends. Don't worry about them. Find a tall robed figure that answers to Steve. Tell him I told you I told him to protect you with his life.
**DM:** He points to the person behind you and goes, can you that person?
**Ash-Arva:** Ah, fuck. Steve, protect go. Take this child to the graveyard. Protect
**DM:** The child just chuckles and says, I can go to the bar. Vera won't let anything happen to me. She's pretty strong.
**Ash-Arva:** Yes. Genlife.
**Ash-Arva:** Steve, go with him, please. I need you to go. Shoot.
**Ash-Arva:** Mama's got work to do.
**Ruddy:** Who knew that something so devastating could happen to a peaceful town like this?
**DM:** This 16 year old Cobalt starts coughing.
**DM:** Everyone make a perception check for me.
**Ruddy:** alright. My perception's not super good.
**Ruddy:** Oh, never mind. That's a 19.
**Vera:** Do I have advantage because I've lived here for so long or no?
**Vera:** För team.
**DM:** Ash has advantage, though.
**Ash-Arva:** What? I mean, I can I can also still see heartbeats?
**DM:** Yes. And one other reason.
**Ash-Arva:** That why I have advantage? Oh, twenty twenty. There's one other reason.
**DM:** Okay. Okay. Ash, because of you being able to see heartbeats, there's one that's familiar.
**Theodin:** Your mother.
**Ash-Arva:** I want heartbeat.
**DM:** One of the nobles from your house. From Nadol your house, but the place you come from.
**DM:** As Steve, the child walks away, but Steve doesn't listen.
**Ash-Arva:** Alright. So is this Noble alright here?
**DM:** The noble is in the crown.
**Ash-Arva:** Just clock eyes with them. I squint at them.
**Ash-Arva:** I can you make a motion with my eyes for them to fuck off?
**DM:** The noble steps office is ignoring you. And you all see
**DM:** This bold dark elf.
**DM:** About 1,500 years old.
**Ash-Arva:** I know what house?
**DM:** A house it used to be a part of?
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. How old? Sorry? 50.
**DM:** 1,500.
**DM:** I would say
**DM:** You're not quite sure.
**Ash-Arva:** He's still mainly alive, so I'm assuming it has to be the House of Rot.
**DM:** This 1,500 year old dark elf steps up, and he's got this white hair.
**DM:** Is gray eyes that seem to pierce into everyone's soul.
**DM:** He's wearing the symbol.
**DM:** Of someone you guys wouldn't expect for someone who's of Elven blood.
**DM:** He's wearing the symbol of Zephus the Abyssal, the one who reigns over the waters. And he just locks up and goes, how pitty sheen that she's dead?
**DM:** Oh, baby. So the star elf walks up to the girl, looks down at the body, and just puffs and goes, oh, shame. She was dead. That's all she was good for was her knowledge.
**Ash-Arva:** Ash's hand very much like, actually, Ash would probably draw the rapier that's by their side. Let's go, you are not welcome here. Fuck off.
**DM:** Earcut says eight yard sign.
**Theodin:** It would be a little bit more subtle ish with, oh, god. My I'm having a tough time mentally over here. Hold on. Give me a second. I just I just lost the cool factor on that entire thing that I had a chance with. Goddamn it. Theoden. Yeah. Theoden would look over and his irises, which were, just a normal hazel green, would become very bioluminescent, almost like his irises were made of LEDs.
**Theodin:** As you looked over at them.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy is, like, clenching his teeth and, like, his hand are, like, sort of subconsciously moving towards his daggers on his hip.
**Ruddy:** And,
**Ruddy:** He he is shaking slightly, a little very obviously angry.
**Ash-Arva:** Vera Vera takes hold of one of her scimitars, boils it in her hand a little, and steps forward. You.
**Ash-Arva:** How long have you been here? That woman was not only good for her knowledge. That woman was a mother. How dare you?
**DM:** He looks at you better and looks around and says, I would recommend not drawing your sword in the middle of a piece. Hold down.
**Theodin:** Oh.
**DM:** I only came here for the festival. Nothing more.
**Ash-Arva:** Say it again. I'm done.
**DM:** So
**Theodin:** Oh, I don't think you're on the top. We can make this a lot less peaceful for you, specifically, if that's what you choose. And he would be walking closer to her and looking, like, down at her. Getting really Vera in her business. Is that what you would if that is if that's what you would like, I know many different ways over my centuries of living to make your life very difficult.
**DM:** They're just a child in my I am only in the tree itself.
**Ash-Arva:** Yes. Pish posh. Honestly.
**Theodin:** You can be you can be one with the dirt for all I care.
**Vera:** You will stand down right this instant.
**Theodin:** As you wish, Cheryl.
**DM:** He looks at Ash and goes, I am only here in a festival. I quite enjoyed the little festival this town offers.
**Ash-Arva:** Flare on his dead law, you are only here for the festival.
**DM:** Is no response. So at that moment, you see Steve moving out of order and walking up to
**DM:** who Here knows draconic?
**DM:** Anyone else?
**Theodin:** I'm checking. I'm trying.
**DM:** You're okay, Kaye.
**Theodin:** And
**DM:** Take your time.
**Theodin:** I hate the mobile UI.
**DM:** I know. I hate it so much.
**Vera:**  Don't mind it. Yeah. You'll be able to in a good way.
**Ash-Arva:** It's in professional season training.
**Theodin:** Where are my languages? Oh, no. Never mind. Never mind. I only know common dwarfish and elvish.
**DM:** Okay. So, Vera, you're the only one that hears this. So it's steep. Go ahead.
**Ash-Arva:** Jen, did you say you knew Treconic as well?
**DM:** Alright. You have access to your phone.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, no. Oh, dear. Yeah. They're on it right now. Yeah.
**DM:** Okay. I am going to send you a DM, Armory, and this is what you do.
**Vera:** Oh, no.
**DM:** But to everyone else, you just hear this cloaked figure speaking in this language that he's so foreign you've never heard it before.
**DM:** To this noble, and the noble is responding.
**Ash-Arva:** That shows Luke says Steven goes, Steve, we need to have a discussion about this when you're finished. Vera is looking very intently at the pair of them.
**Vera:**  Anne has since drawn her other scimitar the second she heard Steve speak. As from Luke's
**Ash-Arva:** Not this man. He just goes
**Ash-Arva:** Shouldn't be too hard to kill, but if you leave and you swear you did not do this, no harm will come to you today.
**DM:** I swear to the dragon. So I did not do
**Ash-Arva:** Right. He didn't do it.
**DM:** Also, don't be worried about my friends here. He used to work for me.
**Ash-Arva:** Right. Steve, we have a discussion about this when when we can.
**DM:** Steve gives no response.
**Ash-Arva:** Two homes for now.
**DM:** Steve does not.
**Ruddy:** There is no Viv in Arentia.
**Vera:** And Ver oh no not not the wrong campaign brain Erann. They start with the same letter shut up shut up they start with the same they start with the same letter Vera would glare very intently at the pair of them and just glare daggers at Steve and Endreconic say go home.
**DM:** Steve responds in common.
**DM:** Goes, you were not my master.
**Ash-Arva:** Steve, are you going to keep following me around?
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. Bye.
**DM:** The noble looks back as he's walking away and goes, I might check.
**DM:** On that where board in town.
**DM:** She might have something to do with it or maybe a part.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, hush. You listen nonsense.
**Ash-Arva:** Right. So the two people he just mentioned, I'm almost certain they're not involved. Ash just turns the rest of you. He goes, those two that he mentioned.
**Ash-Arva:** Almost certainly got involved. Well, yes. I can corroborate this. Corroborate. That worked this.
**Ash-Arva:** Maybe talking to the barkeep might not be a terrible idea.
**Ruddy:** Yes. The bar. I could use that right now.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, you and me both, cutie.
**Ruddy:** His face just goes red.
**Ruddy:** And he just goes would you do you mind? I'm grieving!
**Ruddy:** No. Maybe.
**DM:** We all headed to the bar?
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, sorry. Bad time? I suggest you behave yourself in the water. Remember, this is where the child has gone. Fine. Yes.
**DM:** As you walk into the bar, you hear comfort you see this red?
**DM:** Hooded. Not hood, but, like, there's mic in it. There's just a red mushroom. About five foot ten with this holding, like, a basket of bread. And he's talking to the barkeep and goes some song to them.
**DM:** And the barkeep response, it goes Yeah. He was in here a couple Nightseer ago.
**Ash-Arva:** There anyone who shouldn't be in this room in this room that has a heartbeat?
**DM:** Oh, look at you. No.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. Nine minute oil misters, please. Thank you.
**DM:** Barry looks at he goes, oh, so it's true then.
**Ash-Arva:** I don't know what's true, but I Donald drink.
**DM:** Don't drink on a full moon.
**Ash-Arva:** Aw, fills out fills out hip flask, takes a drink.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy just kind of like walks up to the bar and lays his head down.
**DM:** There it is.
**DM:** Have you guys seen anything strange in town?
**Ash-Arva:** Other than the shadows giving me a middle finger, no.
**Vera:**  Would I have seen anything strange?
**Vera:**  Okay. It's only a 12 save. Only. Fuck. That's a 12.
**DM:** I needed you to get a twelve because you're the sheriff. You would be looking. You would have noticed this hooded figure in town.
**DM:** Vera couple of days before the first.
**DM:** He he was in town for maybe about two weeks.
**DM:** Like he seemed to disappear.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. So Fari would step up and go, yes. Actually, I have seen something quite strange.
**DM:** Ettie, close the door. You have to have an actual talk. And the mushroom just rumbles and says, swear you. Run on me ragged here, furry.
**DM:** And just chuckles oh, don't worry. I'll feed you great. What do you eat again? The mushroom shark because I don't know. I'm not eating food.
**DM:** And he closes to
**Ash-Arva:** Ash is being strong and silent again for a few minutes.
**Ash-Arva:** Maybe, randomly hitting on Ruddy and Vera and, actually, Theoden as well.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy would be hitting on you back, but, like, very poorly. Like, he's using very, very bad pickup lines.
**Vera:** Jenna's just said that Ruddy would be hanging on you back, but, like, very poorly. They they've just left. Go to the bathroom.
**DM:** So you all hear Vera sigh again. She drops her mask, but she the normal barkeep mask. She drops and just rests her head in her hands and goes,
**DM:** There's been a genie hanging around town, and I'm sure the sheriff here knows about it.
**Vera:** Yes. Hooded figure, you know, for about two weeks before the first.
**DM:** He said he was Sarah business, but
**DM:** I didn't trust him. And then the mushroom little mushroom dude speaks up and goes, I saw him too near Yania house last night.
**Vera:** Vera's head snaps towards the mushroom. You saw what and didn't think to? I was passed out drunk. Never mind.
**DM:** You give people the strong one again? Herr just shakes her head and goes, maybe.
**DM:** He just sighs.
**Ash-Arva:** Well, we only start I only started hearing the voices after you gave me the strong stuff.
**Theodin:** No. No. You gave us the you gave us the elixir of whispers of the void, he said, Theoden would have said sarcastically.
**DM:** You're not wrong, the mushroom comments, and says that shit is not meant for human consumption. Are you?
**Theodin:** You really think any of us are human?
**DM:** More elvish.
**DM:** Looks at you guys and says that wasn't really meant for consumption.
**Ruddy:** It tasted mighty like it was meant for consumption, but then the whispers started.
**Theodin:** Are you meaning that it was supposed are you saying that it was supposed to be diluted before consumption?
**DM:** No. It was meant as an offering to the gods or the old gods. Anyway.
**Theodin:** Yeah. Well, I'm well, I'm not a god, so that makes sense.
**Ash-Arva:** Yes. The child.
**DM:** The two seem very entry. What did the child look like?
**Theodin:** Yeah. We've all pretty much had a lucid dream of the star child.
**DM:** What does it look like?
**Vera:**  What did my file look like again? Sorry.
**DM:** So, Nada, yours looks you couldn't quite tell, but there was a mix of wind, fire, and ice.
**Vera:** Couldn't really tell what the child looked like, but I know that the landscape was a mix of wind, fire, ice. The child was trying so desperately to keep their ice hidden behind the fire. It didn't work.
**DM:** Everyone else would know that's not training, guys.
**DM:** That is not the same dream you other the other two of you have.
**Ruddy:** Yeah. Ruddy would speak up and he would say, that's strange. My dream was about a farm that was being erased. A little boy, brown hair about yay high, overalls, reached out to me and said that someone was trying to erase it all. Erase them.
**Theodin:** Same thing for me, only it was essentially in the void of the sky with all the stars falling down.
**Theodin:** These stars, hence, star child.
**DM:** God spoke to you.
**Ash-Arva:** That would explain what happened after I grasped the child's hand.
**Ruddy:** Took thy hand too.
**Vera:** They changed. I saw three things.
**DM:** There's no way. And you see the barkeep run to the back for a moment, and then she runs back to the bar, and she's holding this old book that seems to be
**DM:** Anyone who wants to can make perception checks.
**Vera:**  Where's my phone?
**Theodin:** Damn it. I hit the back arrow.
**Ash-Arva:** Do you wanna roll perception on a book?
**DM:** Court can have advantage if they want it.
**Theodin:** I rolled a 12. I was so close to hitting the deep end next one.
**Ash-Arva:** Gonna roll perception on the book.
**Vera:** You have advantage. 
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, I have advantage on something? 
**Vera:** Yeah. Perception. 
**Ash-Arva:** Why? 
**Vera:**  Screen shit. Oh, hello. Perception. It would fucking roll.
**Theodin:** Hey. You have perception. Why? I don't know.
**Ash-Arva:** 14. 14 for me, sadly.
**DM:** 1914.
**Ash-Arva:** Also, Rainbow, if you can see the role stuff, I'm going to make a d 100 role. You know why.
**DM:** Oh, you're going to. Oh, fuck me. Okay.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, I think it's the fun one.
**DM:** What is that one again? What is that one?
**Ash-Arva:** Give me a moment.
**Ash-Arva:** As I've oh, okay. It doesn't work. It doesn't do anything. It is the, transference of issues.
**DM:** Were allowed to reroll.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, I wanted to give my hangover to Steve.
**DM:** Y'all notice that you don't have a hangover in fact.
**Ash-Arva:** 70. 70. That's a good one. I didn't just spontaneously combust into flames. Okay. So it's I've got a bit of free healing as a bonus action.
**DM:** Okay. Cool. So anyone who got above a 15.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. I can close my ears. Yes. Hello.
**DM:** It's fine. You would notice that the book is made.
**DM:** of human flesh.
**Ruddy:** Uhh, Hei
**DM:** Don't question why I have this. This is a book that is currently supposed to be burned in the pits of Vera herself. And she flips through and goes.
**DM:** Oh, this is not good.
**DM:** Guys took the child's hand.
**Ash-Arva:** Yes. I took the little gold stand.
**Ruddy:** So the betting
**DM:** Good thing. You didn't say no.
**Ash-Arva:** I asked if I could say no. He laughed at me.
**Ruddy:** It's a reduced sort of sighs and relief.
**Ash-Arva:** I almost said no. I didn't.
**DM:** This was meant to happen. There's an issue with your child that I need to do research on. I don't quite know why. Yeah.
**Vera:** It because of the three things?
**Vera:** One was more fiery.
**DM:** Yes. But I have theories, but I need to look into it. Any experience?
**Vera:**  What was the first one?
**DM:** Fire, wind, and ice.
**Vera:**  One was more ensuring with the wind, and
**Vera:** The last one.
**DM:** That's what I'm concerned about, but I'll look into that. This was supposed to happen. She was supposed to die.
**DM:** From what you guys have told me, I think you have to go in
**DM:** Do what the gods asked. Do you know what they said?
**Theodin:** I don't think timeline collapsing some.
**Ash-Arva:** Find out who and and eliminate them. Vera the first time since any of you have really met Ash, there's there's a little glint in their eye and they stop they stand a bit straighter. They stop, like, leaning towards Ruddy very provocatively. And
**Ash-Arva:** They seem almost happy at the order to eliminate something.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy sort of shivers at that.
**Ash-Arva:** Ruddy.
**Theodin:** Are there cereal much?
**Ash-Arva:** Ruddy, I think you are probably the only person that would know what the house of like, what a member of the House of Blood actually is.
**Ash-Arva:** The, the bat. Vampires.
**Ruddy:** Doesn't care how women.
**Ash-Arva:** I know. But at that at that point, it's like that that instinct of kill, kill, kill is there. Your place Vera the secret thing the secret secret that you sent me in DM's rainbow, it's not on the map.
**DM:** No. Yeah. I know. It's not on the back.
**DM:** So you hear the mushroom speak up and go. There's only one person.
**DM:** Who would know much about all of this, and that's the fae of the woods. I can bring it to him if you want.
**Ruddy:** That might be helpful.
**Ruddy:** Shivers again.
**Ash-Arva:** A face? Mhmm. Yeah. Let's go see them. There is a false smile on Ash's face. Do I know this? Yeah. Yeah. Ash is not good at hiding it.
**Ash-Arva:** I'll just do a half glare.
**DM:** So as you all leave, the mush little mushroom group leads you into the woods. And as he's walking, the trees seem to avoid like, they're going to lunge for you guys. But as he's around, they back away.
**DM:** It's like they're afraid they're afraid of this little mushroom dude that's I don't think I ever shared the picture of him.
**Ash-Arva:** Just this little guy.
**DM:** So he is. He is such a little guy, and he is considered the town baby.
**Ash-Arva:** That's a joke from Jen.
**DM:** I mean, you're not far off.
**Ruddy:** Oh, hey. I wasn't far off.
**Ash-Arva:** I love him. He's told with extra steps.
**DM:** So he
**Vera:**  I need to race this mushroom, Ed? 
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, Ash would ask to raid on Ruddy's back again.
**Ruddy:** Do you want to allow Ash to ride on his back?
**Ash-Arva:** Thank you, dear.
**DM:** I don't think he even knows what's the grace of mushroom in this, and that's me begging. Please don't make me look up mushrooms.
**Vera:** Will not make you look up mushrooms.
**DM:** Know you love mushrooms.
**Ruddy:** Just a little guy. That's that's what Reisi is, a little guy.
**DM:** So as he's guiding, you start to hear the trees, like, almost screaming and saying intruders. Intruders. And the mushroom's just waving his stick and going, no. We're friends. Back off, you wee little shits.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy is just, like, making faces at the roots.
**DM:** You all feel I oh, no. Everyone but Ash feels eyes on.
**DM:** Not bad eyes, but just as if someone's keeping an eye on it. And you all approach. As you all start walking, the path you're on seems to go on and on.
**DM:** And then you see this.
**DM:** Yeah. In front of you.
**DM:** To find his fucking stock blocks. I don't remember the fuck he looks like.
**DM:** He crosses his arms and says, what are you doing to my woods?
**Ash-Arva:** Are you doing on this continent, little Faye?
**DM:** These are my what's. Back off, vampire.
**Ash-Arva:** Do I know your character's name, though? Ash. Yeah.
**DM:** No, Jen. That's
**Ash-Arva:** Wise women was killed.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy looks down at Ash and, like, whispers, do you know this person?
**Ruddy:** Assumed it was a high school feud like situation.
**Ash-Arva:** Mhmm. Older than that.
**Vera:**  Vera steps up while those you're whispering and just goes, Yania was murdered, sir.
**DM:** I can't give you the information right away as is my job. However,
**DM:** Then I have to decide.
**DM:** Persuade me to give you the information, and I might.
**Ash-Arva:** I I switch language to a bezel, and I say
**Ash-Arva:** I will arrange a brief secession of hostilities towards your kind.
**Ruddy:** Does everyone keep speaking languages I don't know?
**DM:** Because there are things out of your control.
**Ash-Arva:** There's my forks upwards slightly.
**DM:** Because little Centaur, there are things in this world that aren't for the.
**Ruddy:** Okay then.
**Ash-Arva:** And, yeah, we'll we'll just say that and then just stand there waiting.
**DM:** I will want these guys not to be messed with. He made my my sprites free, and the trees seem to shift. And this fake gets angrier and angrier and goes.
**Vera:**  Oh, DM, very quickly, what, is it, new moon today in the campaign? Is it tomorrow?
**DM:** It was just a full note, so now you've got at least three weeks.
**Ash-Arva:** What color are the pearls? Are they white or red?
**DM:** They should be red 
**Vera:**  Okay. So I should just sit and watch this guy and go, do you actually add another statement and just go I can get you his head.
**DM:** Right.
**DM:** He went to Aidan cave. He went to my fucking case. Stupid. I don't like
**Vera:**  Where is it? Vira snaps into draconic almost, like, instinctively and says, I heard that bastard say out of in cave earlier.
**DM:** He's still speaking in common.
**Vera:** Do you understand your no. You don't.
**Ash-Arva:** That's other elf that Ash here took issue with.
**Ash-Arva:** Was speaking to, I believe, Steve, was it? I'm assuming Steve is here.
**DM:** Yeah. Steve has not left your side.
**Ash-Arva:** Hope that stops when I try to go to bed tonight. And then
**Vera:** Vera turns to Steve, and the interconnect just goes, I've got my eye on you, buddy.
**DM:** Steve does not respond.
**DM:** He does make a note of you understood him.
**Ash-Arva:** Steve will remember this.
**DM:** Etti much. Just may we'll lead you to the floor to the cave.
**Vera:** Okay. Steve should have known that I understood him already because I Yeah. Said to him go home and Yeah. Draconic.
**DM:** Yeah. It's more that he's not around that person, so he would never.
**Ash-Arva:** Mhmm. So are we heading to a cave?
**DM:** Yes. You're you guys can role play if you want for a couple of minutes because I've gotta pull up the fucking thingy thing.
**Ash-Arva:** Ash will actually turn to Theoden.
**Theodin:** Need to help figuring out what's going on.
**Ash-Arva:** So, basically, we have gone to talk to a Faye. Ash does not like this Faye. But they have they have told us where this person is, we think.
**Ash-Arva:** We are heading that way, and Ash will turn to Theodore and just go, so what are you good at?
**Ash-Arva:** The big one obviously has music. This one, I assume, is handy with that ball of theirs. But you, you are curious.
**Theodin:** Well, I can tell you how for the past two and a half centuries of my three hundred and forty years of living, I've been an avid I've been an avid learner of history and various governments and how they work, different civilizations, archaeology even. I am very interested in past civilizations about Vera exceeded.
**Ash-Arva:** If we survive the if we survive the I will sorry. Please. Apologies.
**Theodin:** I'm not done. I'm I'm not done. Yeah. Come on, man. Alright. Give me a second.
**Ash-Arva:** Very sorry. Keep going.
**Ash-Arva:** Darling, you might consider
**Theodin:** Or
**Theodin:** And,
**Theodin:** Theoden would then
**Theodin:** And theoden would just, in a puff of smoke, would just disappear for a moment after uttering a few words and would reappear 10 feet in front of you looking at you. Or I could
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, oh, that is fabulous.
**Theodin:** Or I could tell you about all the facets of magic I have learned over the centuries.
**Ash-Arva:** A true skull.
**Theodin:** Doctor Theoden Einsburn at your service.
**DM:** Can roll a history check if you want, k, for that.
**Ash-Arva:** Ash ever of the House of Blood of Lanzia. And if you Oh, yeah.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy just goes, Ruddy Swiftfoot raises his hands in the air.
**Theodin:** History check, you said? Good. I have a plus eight in that. 25.
**Ruddy:** Has been reading all the history books.
**DM:** Okay.
**Ash-Arva:** Would you like me to explain a bit about Lanzi ARainbow(DM)?
**Ruddy:** I love Lacey.
**DM:** Little bit more than the average person would know.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. So Bosnia is a, is a continent that has a very weird government structure that you're not you are more familiar with than you probably should be to the point that you know that Bosnia is actually ruled by the undead.
**Ash-Arva:** And with a few context clues, you probably Vera that Ash is a vamp is at least partly a vampire.
**Ash-Arva:** And the house of blood specifically is a house of vampires. That is one of the five houses that run
**Ash-Arva:** So ash is a form of nobility.
**DM:** That is what you would have been thinking.
**Ash-Arva:** That's you prob yeah. You probably know the names of the other houses as the house of rot, the house of bones, the house of shades, and the house of ruins. That's probably about it.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, thank you. You're most gracious.
**DM:** As you guys reached the edge of the forest, the face stops and goes, this is as far as I can take you. And the mushroom dude says, I can't go any further.
**Ruddy:** We're on our own.
**DM:** No response.
**Ash-Arva:** Well, Luanda Steve. Steve, watch this entrance to the wood, please. I would quite like whatever is in here not to get past us. You are our last line of defense.
**Ash-Arva:** I get a nod?
**Ash-Arva:** I'm sorry.
**Vera:**  He grumbling in draconic?
**Vera:**  Oh, okay.
**DM:** Oh, yeah. You get a nod, but he's grumbling. And, by the way, if you look at I am screen sharing them, by the way. No. He's just grumbling, like unintelligible grumbling. He actually, no. He looks at Vera and goes, said, look.
**DM:** Intriconic. Intriconic.
**Ruddy:** Ruddy just grumbles at the fact that everyone's speaking languages he doesn't understand.
**Ruddy:** Thank you. Wait a minute.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, oh, I'm sorry, darling. I'll try to keep my language plain and simple for you. You see? Vera looks back at Steve and just goes, I will do my best. Endroponic.
**DM:** Alright. Let me know when everyone's clicked on the list writing.
**Ash-Arva:** I am on the map. I'm on the map. Well, they're on the map. I am on the map. No. Please know you'll summon him.
**Ruddy:** Oh, yeah. In the map. Okay. It's loading. It's still loading. It's done loading.
**DM:** K. Don't forget to I have a battle map ready for this because you're not gonna need it.
**Ruddy:** You might wanna get back on your computer.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay? Mhmm. He didn't summon him? No. You didn't. You're fine. Oh, thank you.
**Ruddy:** Might wanna get on your computer because, Rainbow's sharing a stream.
**Ash-Arva:** Weer bouwmaat of mee-bouw.
**Ruddy:** Lots of blue. Oh, no no more blue.
**Ash-Arva:** Less blue. There is it is a massive map.
**Theodin:** Bald. Bald. My eyes. Hey, Etti.

**DM:** As you guys approach,
**DM:** I have purple.
**Theodin:** Hey, Discord. You can failing on me now.
**Ash-Arva:** Hello back. Hello back.
**DM:** As you guys approach, you see this tall ifsight.
**DM:** That is so it leaves 300 feet tall. And it looks like it's not too stable.
**DM:** You see two entrances to a cave that seem to be blocked off and three others you can enter. The middle one has blood at the entrance. It's dry.
**Ruddy:** Oh dear. Ugh, do we have to go down the bloody path?
**Ash-Arva:** I would like to stick by me. I'll keep you nice and safe, all of you.
**Ruddy:** Okay. Fine. He sort of, like, bumped up against Ash.
**Ash-Arva:** I would just laugh and go, of course you want. Then I would just laugh and go, of course you want to go down the bloody path, Ash. Yeah.
**Ruddy:** He sort of bumps up against Ashi goes Am I close enough?
**Ash-Arva:** Yes, cutie. Nice and close.
**Ash-Arva:** And it just starts laughing.
**Ash-Arva:** As a note that, Ash has walked through this forest, like, in heels without really struggling.
**DM:** So as you guys get to the entrance, you're right you're right at the entrance. You're starting to enter the cave. And as you
**Ash-Arva:** Before we enter, can I actually use my second use of BloodSense, and is there anything hidden within a 20 feet of me?
**DM:** 20.
**DM:** Like that. You see?
**Ash-Arva:** I will I will I will mention this just before we enter. One happy.
**Ash-Arva:** On. And you see Ash's eyes have gone like this instead of being, like, normal, like, dark brown irises, the entire eye has gone blood red.
**DM:** You guys?
**Ruddy:** Are quite the enigma at you.
**Ash-Arva:** Thank you.
**DM:** You guys start to enter, you notice on either side where there should be just walls. You notice it with spikes, skulls.
**DM:** Far do you go in?
**Ash-Arva:** Steve. Steve. Hey, Cole. Come back to Steve. Steve. Can you collect some skulls for me? Thank you, dear.
**Ruddy:** We're pulling a Miriam who I don't know doesn't exist.
**DM:** Steve is just in the pit now.
**Ash-Arva:** I I might I so I tell everyone that there's someone in there, and I go, what's the game plan? I defer to your knowledge of your continent more than mine.
**Ruddy:** Go in. Raise hell.
**Theodin:** Praise hail. Praise hail.
**Ruddy:** Don't know. I said raise hell.
**Ash-Arva:** Look at
**Ruddy:** Apparently this guy's caused a lot of issues.
**Ash-Arva:** See what they want first, but be on your guard. I do not trust that.
**Vera:**  One of my guardsmen is missing. I would like them back in one piece.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, you will not get them back in one piece. Mhmm.
**Ash-Arva:** How many pieces are you capable of?
**Ruddy:** Better now than number.
**Ash-Arva:** Rather not answer that question right now. Are we going or not? 
**Vera:** Yes. 
**Ash-Arva:** On we go. See you then.
**Ash-Arva:** Recommend standing slightly further behind me.
**DM:** Okay. What is the order? Who who is going in first?
**Ash-Arva:** Ash has no fear of mortality. Ash would like to go first.
**Ruddy:** I'm just going behind Ash trying to hide my giant self behind her tiny body.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. You're, like, you're close to seven foot tall, but Ash is breaking five and a half just.
**Ash-Arva:** You were bringing up the rear as you watch Steve, like, hop into one of these pits and start chucking skulls out of it.
**DM:** Does this order look good?
**Ash-Arva:** Thank you, darling. Does that look good for everyone? Bit more spaced out, I think.
**Theodin:** Yeah. What? Yes. I'm here.
**Ash-Arva:** Does that order look good for you?
**Ruddy:** It spells art artvuh.
**Ash-Arva:** Study assault, like, second to last.
**Ruddy:** Do you want the rest of my rice? The smell is making me nauseous.
**Theodin:** The smell of rice is making you nauseous.
**Ruddy:** Put some of the sesame sauce in it.
**Theodin:** Sure. I can take it.
**Ash-Arva:** Open my second
**Ruddy:** Thank you. It's at my desk.
**DM:** Are we all ready?
**Ash-Arva:** I might just quickly call a little heartbeat. Your reckoning is here.
**Theodin:** Now, I want y'all to know that I have been here this whole time, and I have been listening.
**Theodin:** At least attempting to listen, and I don't and I don't know what's going on. And I'm and I'm worried that my brain fog is getting worse.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. We are about to enter combat.
**Ash-Arva:** There is a person in this cave who is probably the murderer, we are pretty sure, by the amount of blood. And,
**Ash-Arva:** I know where they are and they are in here and I have said to everyone basically get a bit further behind me.
**Ash-Arva:** Now we may fight.
**Theodin:** What is your class, by chance?
**Ash-Arva:** Elriga. I am a fighter, basically. I'm basically a fighter. I am a tank. You know Viv's second class? The one where he can put, like, seals and stuff on?
**Ash-Arva:** Like, Target says hat.
**DM:** It's that glass.
**Ash-Arva:** It might be under the Oh, this one now.
**Ash-Arva:** Might be in the living room. Oh, that's here. Oh, okay.
**Theodin:** Hold on. What if oh, shit. Fuck.
**Theodin:** Core Core. Your your your your character name.
**Theodin:** Okay. Hold on.
**Ash-Arva:** You're good. Yes.
**Theodin:** Come here for a moment.
**Ash-Arva:** I will this is before we go in. I will just step close to that, Theoden. And
**Theodin:** Take my hand.
**Ash-Arva:** I will offer my hand very daintily.
**Theodin:** Theoden would grasp your hand, and then you would suddenly feel a surge of strength. Raise him.
**Ash-Arva:** One moment. Mhmm. K. I can't hear you. One sec. Oh, take mine briefly. Mine is
**DM:** Their headphones might have died. Give, like, a minute.
**Ash-Arva:** Jag kan ge er igen.
**Theodin:** And Theoden would say, raise hell. And you would feel your strength surge. Please, temporarily.
**Ash-Arva:** Dexter dexterity is my chosen. But, yeah, if you're giving me it's enhanced ability, mister Bing. Yes.
**Theodin:** Oh, n never mind. Yeah. Raise your dexterity.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. Thank you very much. That will actually be very helpful for some of the things I need to do.
**Ash-Arva:** And I'm gonna actually pull my headphones off my computer. So give
**Theodin:** Mine sails are without wind now.
**Ruddy:** Oh, are you okay, baby?
**Ash-Arva:** Yes. Yeah. Sorry. K.
**Theodin:** I thought I thought I was doing something cool. Don't worry about it.
**Ruddy:** Are doing something cool.
**DM:** You are, dude. This is really cool. I'm really proud of you guys.
**Ash-Arva:** Right. So I'm assuming we're about to roll initiative.
**DM:** Before we do, in the caves, you hear an echo.
**DM:** How did the gods get into power?
**DM:** Don't familiar your voice. I don't know if you're on the other wise one.
**DM:** Oh, no. It's a ghost.
**DM:** Responding. The gods went into power by killing a previous god when they were mortal. The killing of the gods ended the era, and the world was sunk into ruins. With magic being unstable, the world looked to the six heroes for help as they rose to divinity as they bought her power. The imbalance in nature led to the creation of the light tree as the Naras used the last Vera clerical power to create a new better magic fruit magic. And so the tree was created to watch over all of kin.
**DM:** How did she live so long? I didn't part out.
**DM:** You know who killed you?
**DM:** Okay. How far are you going in?
**Ash-Arva:** Uh-huh. Take me just before that blood stained near the center. Yeah.
**Ruddy:** I'm just gonna stay behind Ash.
**Theodin:** I will be in the back line.
**Theodin:** Because I am now mister Squishy and not muscle mommy.
**DM:** Alright. At your own role initiative.
**Theodin:** Oh, well, shit. 22.
**Ruddy:** Almost bad,
**Vera:**  Yeah. And because everybody is within 30 feet of fifteen, twenty, 20 five. Yeah. Everyone has advantage because we're all within 30 of Vera. Vera.
**Theodin:** I rolled a why did I roll a natty 20 on initiative?
**Ruddy:** Mister squishy comes in clutch. I got 18.
**Ruddy:** I already rolled advantage. I rolled worse.
**Ash-Arva:** Everybody has initiative. Advantage. That one. Everyone has advantage. If people want to. Yeah. You got a Natalia. You can't.
**Theodin:** I I don't think I can roll. I I I don't think I can roll for advantage.
**Theodin:** Yeah.
**DM:** Hold on. Vera, what did you get?
**Vera:** You've got an at twenty. That's the best you're gonna get. Yeah. You don't need to. You're fine. You're 23.
**Ruddy:** Up? Ruddy got 18. 18.
**Ash-Arva:** Initial. 13.
**DM:** Cool. Remind me again how that twenties are decided.
**Ash-Arva:** It is good.
**DM:** If two people got in that 20,
**Theodin:** I got I got a '22 because it's 20 plus two.
**DM:** Oh, no. None of you guys got an natty twenty.
**Ash-Arva:** I didn't get an at twenty. I got a seventeen. No.
**Theodin:** Yeah. But you said but you said 23.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. You got 17 plus six.
**Theodin:** Plus six?
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. Plus five, and then they've got an item that gives them an extra bonus to initiative.
**Ash-Arva:** They are dexterous.
**DM:** Do I wanna mention the actually, no. I'm just gonna keep this order. Give me a minute.
**Ash-Arva:** Wish I did alright now. I wish I fucking did. So I would give it to you. Amria going, do you have the thing where you can switch initiatives? And I'm like, oh my god. I wish I did.
**DM:** Oh, this is interesting.
**DM:** Yeah. It's probably been just about a minute.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, I as a note, I can sense his heartbeat for a minute.
**Theodin:** I just have an item that grants me clairvoyance.
**DM:** Yeah. You do. I gave it to you.
**Ash-Arva:** The voice is gonna be very good if this guy vanishes.
**DM:** First is the enemy.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay.
**DM:** I need my fucking calculator to say no.
**DM:** Only right now, I believe, Ash can see.
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. Because this place is quite dark, isn't it? Dark vision. Only 60 feet. Wait. I can't frame the page. It's 60 feet. That all dark vision is 60 feet, which only gets you to about
**Theodin:** No. Dark dark elves or Drow, if you wanna be politically correct, are, 20.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, yeah. And damp here are technically 20 as well. Sixty sixty only gets you to about here. Fuck. So you can't see. Okay. I can, though. Well, no more like I've got the, predator heat seeking vision, and I could just see his heartbeat.
**DM:** Yeah. So
**Theodin:** I also have a the spell dark vision, which can enhance range up to, a 50 feet.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. That's that's a really good spell. Oh, no. Currently, just me.
**Theodin:** Mhmm. But we already have but we already have people who can see dark vision, so I don't think we need it.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. Okay.
**Theodin:** All want to know what the component is for darkvision?
**Theodin:** A dry a dried carrot.
**DM:** So
**DM:** Since you're able to see.
**Ash-Arva:** He doesn't know that.
**DM:** You shouted it.
**DM:** Yes. Exactly. He knows, but you know he's there.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, I said, hey, little heartbeat. Oh, I mean Fine. Yeah. You're right.
**DM:** You would let me pull that.
**Ash-Arva:** No. I wouldn't.
**DM:** You see him fly up in the air.
**Ash-Arva:** How high.
**DM:** He is 30 feet in the air right now.
**DM:** Can't fucking spell, so I don't remember what this does.
**DM:** He moves he flies up 30. He's gonna move.
**DM:** Right here.
**DM:** And he is Chris. That is.
**DM:** Okay. He is testing.
**Ash-Arva:** On who? Okay. Believer is a spell attack roll, if I'm not mistaken.
**DM:** That's what I'm looking. That's what I had to pull up because I don't remember because I don't have a memorized.
**DM:** So that would be yes.

**Ash-Arva:** Oh, game. Should look into that.
**Theodin:** Okay.
**Theodin:** Let's see. Rainbow, please make me a deck saving Vera or just a deck's check. I I have no idea.

**Ash-Arva:** Oh, I'm I'm a healer of myself. I am. I heal myself and no one else. It's called biting people.
**Theodin:** Okay.
**Theodin:** Well, that
**Theodin:** Fuck. No. I can't do that. You're standing right next to him.
**Ash-Arva:** If it's like an AOE thing, you can put it, like, to the side. It misses me.
**Theodin:** I mean, it would be kind of fun.
**DM:** What you like to what you like to do?
**Ruddy:** Do it. Do it.
**Theodin:** No. Hey. Hey. Hey. I'm Nadol.
**Ruddy:** You're okay. You're okay, baby.
**Theodin:** I I I mhmm.
**Theodin:** God, I feel like a psych ward case right now.
**Theodin:** Sure. Just Firebolt.
**DM:** Okay. What's the range of it?
**Theodin:** 20 feet.
**Ash-Arva:** And range very easily.
**DM:** Yeah. I'm gonna say you move up, like, 10 feet so you're in range of Ruddy.
**Theodin:** That's a net 20. High crit.
**DM:** Yep. That hits.
**Theodin:** That's 29 damage.
**Ash-Arva:** And that's fire damage.
**Ruddy:** Is he is he resistant to fire?
**DM:** Is gonna use his legendary resistance.
**DM:** Yes. To take only 25, you said? How many?
**Ash-Arva:** To take half damage, which is 29.
**Ruddy:** Like, that would be so this could be 15. Right?
**Ash-Arva:** No. For me
**DM:** No. He's vulnerable to fire.
**Ash-Arva:** Reasons, he takes 29 points of damage.
**DM:** He he basically was gonna take double damage if I if he didn't do that.
**Ruddy:** Oh, okay.
**DM:** He is looking kind of better. He he looks very grumpy.
**DM:** Next up is layer action.
**Theodin:** Oh, Jesus.
**DM:** So
**Ash-Arva:** K Kea has just showed up, done about 40 points of damage.
**Theodin:** I'm the I'm supposed to be the utility caster.
**Ruddy:** Yeah. Well, looks like you're through to DPS.
**Ash-Arva:** But you you're DPS now, bitch.
**Theodin:** I can't even DPS that well. That was by chance a crit on a cantrip. Most of my spells are utility.
**Ash-Arva:** Uh-huh. Only with a. Yeah.
**Ruddy:** It's a yeah. But he used his legendary resistance. I think he only has one of those.
**DM:** Okay. I am going to need Etti, Ruddy, and Theoden to roll a strength saving throw.
**Theodin:** Goddamn it.
**Ruddy:** Not 20. 20 3.
**DM:** Success.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, fuck. Sex.
**DM:** And two fails. So you see these subvines that are on the edge. Start wrapping around feet and slacks, and you both have the grapple condition.
**Ash-Arva:** Your movement speed is zero. There is no other effect for either of you.
**Ruddy:** Basically, you can't move.
**Theodin:** Oh, for fuck's sake.
**DM:** You cannot escape until it is destroyed.
**DM:** After that, it is Ruddy.
**Ash-Arva:** Do you need to escape?
**Ruddy:** Ruddy is going to,
**Ruddy:** You within, 60 feet of me, Ash? And if so, do you need healing?
**Ash-Arva:** Not quite, but I couldn't do. I mean, I'm on about half health. I'm fine.
**Ash-Arva:** My plan is to heal it all up next time.
**DM:** No. Because, Ash is forty five feet. So no.
**Ruddy:** I am going to, move forward slightly and cast faerie fire. You have to make a dex save.
**DM:** Far you wanna move?
**Ruddy:** About 10 feet.
**DM:** And a deck safe, you said?
**DM:** Get in the fucking box.
**Ruddy:** It it passes.
**DM:** Decent sucks.
**Ruddy:** Do you tick do you tick half damage?
**Ash-Arva:** Every few moments. Very dangerous man. Verify would just give advantage on all attack rules against them, I believe.
**DM:** Don't know what it does.
**Ruddy:** Says objects in a 20 foot cube within range are outlined in blue or green or violet light. Each creature in the cube is also outlined if it fails dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10 foot radius and can't benefit from the invisible condition.
**Vera:** Shit. I just got grappled. Do I need to make a save to see if I'm keeping up Hunter's Mark? 
**Ash-Arva:** No. You're not being dealt damage. 
**Vera:**Okay. 
**Ash-Arva:** It's when you're dealt damage, you might lose it. 
**Vera:**Okay.
**Ruddy:** I am useless.
**Theodin:** I'm useless. I have a armor class of 12.
**DM:** Ash, you're up next.
**DM:** Okay. Cannot be counterspilled.
**Ash-Arva:** I can't move. Not like I was going to. I mean, we've also done so much damage. So first, my bonus action, I'm going to, invoke hell for emboldened allies targeting only myself to heal myself up 25 hit points. It is not a spell. I do not cast spells.
**DM:** Okay. I genuinely don't know what that is. So
**DM:** How low were you?
**Ash-Arva:** I am back up to full. I am fine. So everyone just watching. I was 25 hit points down. So, Ashley, what happens there is at all the blood and the wounds that Ash has taken, just like the blood just sucks back in and the wounds seal over and she looks up at em and goes now this is going to be fun first attack
**DM:** Hi. It's a little vampire.
**Ash-Arva:** That is a $25.25 to hit.
**Theodin:** She's about to mouth harass a bag of flush.
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. Nine points of piercing damage, and I am going to burn the seal attached to him to deal three d six fire damage, which is 10 fire damage.
**DM:** And that can't be dodged, Hannah.
**DM:** Okay. So that's how much?
**Ash-Arva:** The seal? No. No. 10. So 20. So 20. And then with my second attack, I will try and hit him again. That is a 26 to hit.
**Ash-Arva:** That would be 14 points of damage and as a part of that attack and we do place an OCO on him
**DM:** Is going to use Cedany genie's dodge to take half damage.
**DM:** So it's his turn. And do you see him?
**Ash-Arva:** Yeah. Down to seven. And he has another seal on his face. So everyone watches as this first seal, like, erupts in flame right over his face and then stab him again and a second one reappears, like, on the blackened mark. I'm just like Oh. Oh only I can see the seal that's a shame that's how irregular works oh that damn oh shut you had to keep reminding me of that when I was Viv come on oh yeah but yeah, so she just smiles and goes, well, isn't this fun? And her fangs elongate. I'm done. Yep.
**DM:** After that attack, he's not looking too well. So he is going to let me see.
**Ash-Arva:** Please run away. Please try and run away. Please try and run away.
**DM:** Okay. So
**DM:** You see as he grumbles and
**DM:** He touches a ring on his finger and points it at chest, sharps.
**Ash-Arva:** That's only a 14.
**DM:** Nope. It's 19 for this.
**DM:** So as it takes over,
**Ash-Arva:** Okay. Yeah. The save for John Parson is wasting 15, don't they? No. Oh. Yeah. Vera me, 15. And that's your spell casting. Okay. He doesn't take over. I just see him as a friend. I don't see my I don't see my former allies as enemies. I just see him as a friend, which means I won't stab him when he tries to run away.
**DM:** As he does that and you feel a familiar cold hand on your shoulder.
**DM:** It says give me one rep. No one else hears that.
**DM:** And he
**DM:** It disengages, and
**Ash-Arva:** And I can't stab him in the throat. That's a shame. Yeah.
**DM:** Is still flying in the air, so he would go
**DM:** No. She wouldn't go there.
**Ash-Arva:** Would run away like a baby.
**Ash-Arva:** He's running like baby, darling.
**Ruddy:** You run like a bitch.
**DM:** He moves up to one of these crystals with a broken statue. Ash, you're finally able to see it. Behind you, you see
**DM:** Six crystals, all of different colors.
**DM:** One, the red one, seems to be covered with this coal roof, and the statue in front of it seems to be broken. You see there's also this casket.
**DM:** And that is his second. That is his turn. Vera, you're up next.
**Ash-Arva:** I can't do much, so I'm just gonna try and shoot the bitch again.
**DM:** Mean, you can try to break out of the snares.
**Ash-Arva:** Higher. Or you could just shoot him. You are still in short range.
**DM:** You can attack the snares. They have n h b.
**DM:** How far can you shoot?
**Ash-Arva:** No. I'm just gonna shoot him. One fifty is the short range. Long range is 600. Yeah. So can I shoot him?
**Ash-Arva:** You're about a 20 away, I think.
**Ash-Arva:** In range. I'm not a disadvantage.
**DM:** He's at 01:30 right now.
**Ash-Arva:** Uh-huh. Yeah. You're you're in short range. Yep. Badabang. Not badabang. That's a 14. Try again. 18. Yes. Okay. So it's one d a plus five, eight, 20 four, three. So 11 with no resistances. His mark is a one. So 12 damage. Yeah. Fuck. That's an action. Never mind. I mean, you could step out of
**Ash-Arva:** The Vitamins. Would teleportation work?
**DM:** Have to attack them. You are grapple and restrained.
**Ash-Arva:** You can you can still teleport. Right?
**DM:** You have the restraint condition until you escape or the snare holding it is destroyed.
**Ash-Arva:** Think you can Mistsplitter out of that then.
**DM:** It does not say that you can't.
**Ash-Arva:** Escape leaves. If you're teleporting you are disappearing from your space. I'd say yes, but you're the it's your call, Rainbow(DM).
**DM:** Gonna say no for this.
**DM:** Next is theater. You're up next.
**Ash-Arva:** Do you still have produced flame? Or did you remove it for dual weapon fighting? We removed it. Fuck. Anyway, yeah. I think you're done then. You removed it. Did I send it to ours? K. He's running away like baby. I am charmed, so I can't pursue him.
**Ruddy:** He be running like a little bitch. I just said he be running like a little bitch.
**Ruddy:** Be running.
**DM:** The enemy basically charmed Ash and ran away.
**Ash-Arva:** Please keep me running. I'm gonna quickly run to the bathroom. Speaking of running.
**Theodin:** So he's gone gone?
**DM:** No. He's not gone. He's just further into the cave.
**Theodin:** That might not be a problem.
**Theodin:** If I can pull up the right menu.
**DM:** All good. Take your time.
**Theodin:** I am going to
**Theodin:** Misty step thirty thirty feet
**Theodin:** Oh, god. Fucking damage.
**Theodin:** Okay. Never mind. My
**Theodin:** I can what?
**DM:** You can fight themed snares to break up. So the snares, yeah, they do not have much HP, and they are pretty easy to hit.
**Theodin:** Am I not able to teleport out of the vines?
**DM:** Is a genie.
**Ruddy:** A genie, but not a genius. Well, I should use that.
**Theodin:** We're fighting and we're fighting and gaining?
**Ruddy:** The bitch.
**Theodin:** Kiddo. I don't have any weapons equipped. Goddamn it.
**Ash-Arva:** I've been told we've been told, no. They are magic lines. Kinda. This dude, how far away? You've got You can trip. You can can trip them, I'm assuming.
**Theodin:** I keep going to the wrong menu.
**DM:** Yeah. These are
**Theodin:** I'll I'll just fuck. Hell, I'm touching them anyway. Shocking grasp.
**Theodin:** Does a 21 hit.
**Theodin:** It's about having points of damage.
**DM:** You see as the snares around you break away and disappear. You are now free.
**Ruddy:** Saw the bonus action.
**Ash-Arva:** And you can start
**Theodin:** Well, there goes my action. Alright. Yeah. But there but there's no point in using it anymore. I'll just move I'll just move to 30 feet.
**DM:** Next is
**DM:** It's 10PM. Midnight. Okay. Fuck you too, Google. Next is Ruddy.
**Ruddy:** Okay, Ruddy is going to, he's not grappled, so he's gonna misty step closer.
**Ruddy:** I can move up to 30 feet, so I'm gonna move who's 30 feet, sir?
**Ruddy:** That wasn't a dumb that wasn't a dumb idea.
**DM:** Okay. How far can you misspeak stuff?
**Ruddy:** So, hold on, my movement is 40 feet. Okay, I'm gonna move 40 feet, and then Misty Step is 30 feet.
**DM:** You can now see it.
**Ash-Arva:** And then 40 feet and then another 30. You see Ash just, like, glass eyed standing still.
**Ruddy:** Can I can I look at Ash and go, what are you doing just standing there? Ah, crap. You've been charmed.
**Ruddy:** I hope can I can I slap her?
**Ash-Arva:** He's my friend now. Slapping me would wake me up. Or shooting me. Or shooting me.
**Ruddy:** That's true. That's true.
**DM:** She's standing on top of a 45 foot tall statue.
**Ruddy:** But I used my misty steps, so that's my action.
**Theodin:** Speed step is a bonus action.
**Ruddy:** But I moved.
**Theodin:** It's still a satisfaction.
**Ruddy:** Okay. Then,
**Ash-Arva:** Or hitting me with magic. That's your bonus action. As your move movement bonus action, you still have your action itself.
**Ruddy:** I still have my action. Oh. I have one hold person left. Would rest lesser restoration help charmed?
**Ash-Arva:** I believe it does re remove the charmed condition.
**Ruddy:** I'm gonna cast lesser restoration on ash.
**DM:** No. He'd have to touch for a lesser restoration.
**Ruddy:** Oh, yeah. I do.
**Ruddy:** Can I convince you to jump down?
**Ash-Arva:** Think it's always a is it touch? Is it not one and l? Shame. Don't worry. I'll take you next time. Go, Katie. I'll come down.
**DM:** It's Nadol, and trash's term is after yours.
**Ash-Arva:** You can you can hold your action. Well, you could hold your action.
**Ruddy:** Yeah, I'll just have to wait on nothing. I'm gonna hold my action. I'm gonna hold my action for when ash gets down. What's up?
**Theodin:** It's not your turn, can you come here, please?
**Ruddy:** Sure. Are you okay?
**Ash-Arva:** Измеют.
**Ruddy:** Gonna hold my action for when Ash gets down. I'm gonna go check on Kaye. I'll be right back.
**DM:** Which one are you following?
**DM:** Okay. So you take two damage.
**DM:** And I'm guessing Ruddy.
**DM:** Yeah. You are freed from charm.
**Ash-Arva:** So I will just leap off. Because of Kat's grace, I ignore 30 feet of the fall damage. So I take one d six. Towards, towards Ruddy. Ruddy wants to see me. Ow. Ruddy will probably, if Ruddy's holding Lesser Restoration, I think Ruddy will cast it. That's five feet of my movement. Yeah. So I'll move 10 feet closer, free from charm. And then that is 15 feet gone. So I've got another 20 feet.
**DM:** Yes. He does.
**Ash-Arva:** To go. Five, ten, 15, 20. Gets me underneath him, basically. Please keep in mind the two elves are still fucking rap all that. I know. Only you are. I get underneath him, basically. And how far up is he? Cool. I guess I am going to he's got a seal on him currently. I am going to take one of take my heels and I am going to throw them at him as they have a ranged weapon attack.
**DM:** I mean, how you enroll us?
**DM:** Would you like to do this?
**Ash-Arva:** I will first one misses sadly. Second one is a 24 to hit. Eight points of damage, and I'm going to burn the seal I placed on him. That's three d That is three d six fire damage. Vera Six double to 12. And so I think she's just she is angry. She is annoyed. This man got in her head and she's like You get in my head at least part of me gets in yours and just one heel makes him dodge to the side as the second one goes straight through one of his eye sockets
**DM:** You see, as he falls to the ground, fleeting out, little picture falls out of his pocket.
**Ash-Arva:** And then his head erupts in flame. I do not look at it. Well, no. I take it. I just put it in my pocket. I don't look at it. It's for the pocket. God, I don't know what it is. From where I am, can I see her pocket?
**DM:** I mean, technically, it's in a straight line, almost. I mean yeah.
**DM:** Yeah. He did it.
**DM:** You take any of his rings? He has two of them.
**Ash-Arva:** Probably it's for the pocket card and I do I, pull out my actually using my talons I start to rip this man's head off. I promise someone his head. Should I keep him alive? I'm gonna make a roll. I have speak with dead. I have one chart on. I I'm still gonna make the roll. Okay. No. I I rip his head off. Yeah. I take them all. I start with all the.
**DM:** Notice in one of the rings, because of who you are, there is the soul of Yania of the wise.
**DM:** That that that's all I technically had, and it's
**DM:** I think Jen wants to go check on too.
**Theodin:** I'm here. I was listening to everything. Yippee. You killed the stinky.
**Theodin:** Hey. That's my mentor.
**Ash-Arva:** Oh, that goes in my pocket. The House of Ruins will enjoy that. Okay. Are Kaye and Jan still here? You did amazing, Rainbow. Hello? Hi. So I may have killed someone. I may have decapitated someone. I may have stolen the soul of Yania otherwise. You don't know that. Well, Well, it's currently just in my pocket. I might give it to someone eventually. But I think I think that's where we might stop because I am very tired.
**DM:** The bot. The bot. I wanna see what it does.
