### **1. Root Magic**

**Tapping into the Natural Weave**

#### **Origins and Connection**

- Root Magic flows directly from **[[Nations of Arenthia/the Life Tree\|the Life Tree]]**, which acts as the central conduit for all natural energy in Arenthia.
- Practitioners draw power from the Tree’s roots, which spread across the world, and channel it into spells tied to nature, life, and primal forces.

#### **Principles**

- Root Magic emphasizes **harmony** with the environment and balance with the world’s natural energy.
- It is instinctive, often requiring an innate connection to the Tree. Overuse or selfish manipulation can disrupt this balance and sever the practitioner’s connection.

#### **Applications**

- **Elemental Manipulation:** Control over fire, water, earth, and air in natural forms.
- **Life Magic:** Healing, plant growth, and communion with animals.
- **Territorial Defense:** Creating natural barriers like living walls, vine traps, or elemental storms.
- **Environmental Enhancements:** Enriching soil, calming storms, or cleansing polluted areas.

#### **Practitioners and Legacy**

- **Aelindra Starbloom** pioneered collective Root Magic with her **Harmony Roots** technique.
- Modern druids, shamans, and treemen are the primary users of Root Magic.

### **2. Arcane Magic**

**Magic through Study and Force**

#### **Origins and Development**

- Arcane Magic manipulates the **Weave**, the invisible magical lattice permeating the world, rather than harmonizing with it.
- It relies on **intellect, discipline, and experimentation** to shape raw magical energy into controlled spells.

#### **Principles**

- Arcane Magic focuses on **precision and power**, treating magic as a tool to be mastered rather than a force to respect.
- It often involves incantations, gestures, and magical symbols, as well as the use of artifacts and spellbooks.

#### **Applications**

- **Combat Spells:** Fireballs, lightning bolts, and teleportation for direct offense or defense.
- **Utility Magic:** Teleportation circles, invisibility, and magical wards.
- **Enchantment:** Imbuing objects with magical properties.
- **Summoning:** Bringing forth creatures or entities to serve the caster.

#### **Practitioners and Legacy**

### **3. Psionic Magic**

**Manifesting Willpower and the Mind**

#### **Origins and Philosophy**

- It represents the power of the **mind and spirit** to alter reality, requiring immense mental strength and control.

#### **Principles**

- Psionics involves **manifesting internal energy** rather than drawing from external sources.
- Practitioners train their minds to sharpen their focus, emotions, and self-awareness.

#### **Applications**

### **4. Runic Magic**

**The Language of Creation**

#### **Origins and Structure**

- Runic Magic derives from the **Language of Creation**, a primordial system of symbols left by the gods during the world’s formation.
- Practitioners inscribe glyphs and runes to channel magical energy in controlled, repeatable ways.

#### **Principles**

- Runic Magic is **precise and methodical**, relying on the correct arrangement and activation of runes.
- It is often seen as a structured alternative for those disconnected from the Life Tree.

#### **Applications**

- **Enchantment:** Crafting magical tools, weapons, and armor.
- **Protective Wards:** Inscribing glyphs on buildings or areas for defense.
- **Construct Creation:** Building autonomous magical devices or golems.
- **Utility Magic:** Creating glyphs for light, heat, or communication.

#### **Practitioners and Legacy**

### **5. Divine Magic**

**Channeling the Power of the Gods**

#### **Origins and Source**

- Divine Magic is granted by the gods, who draw their power from the Life Tree.
- It relies on **faith, devotion, and ritual**, with the practitioner serving as a conduit for their deity’s will.

#### **Principles**

- Divine Magic requires loyalty to the god’s teachings and domain. Betrayal or misuse of this power often results in its loss.
- It is guided by the moral and spiritual alignment of the practitioner with their god’s principles.

### **6. Forbidden Magic** 

**Magic Beyond the Bounds of Balance**

- Forbidden Magic represents practices that disrupt the natural order, often considered taboo or dangerous.
- Includes **necromancy**, **soul manipulation**, and the reckless use of Tetra Crystals.

#### **Principles**

- Forbidden Magic often offers immense power but at a steep cost, such as personal corruption or damage to the Life Tree’s roots.
- Practitioners are often shunned or hunted by the Order of Arenthia.

#### **Applications**

- **Necromancy:** Raising the dead or binding souls.
- **Reality Distortion:** Warping time, space, or natural laws.
- **Soulbinding:** Trapping or enslaving the essence of living beings.

#### **Practitioners and Legacy**

- While no major figures openly practice Forbidden Magic, its traces appear in ancient ruins and rogue factions.

### **Interplay Between Magic Types**

While each type of magic has its distinct philosophy and methods, they are not entirely separate. Practitioners often blend elements of different magic types to create hybrid disciplines:

- **Runic-Root Hybrids:** Combining Runic precision with Root Magic’s natural flow.
- **Psionic-Arcane Experiments:** Merging willpower with structured spellcraft.
- **Divine-Root Synergy:** Using faith to enhance natural magic.
