##### About Lamiahold
---
Lamiahold is the passage of the Grave Father, [[The World of Havar/The gods/Ulfera the Grave Father\|Ulfera]]. This is the month where he was seen to rise to power on the 20th of Lamiahold in the year 3.  He Honors those that have passed and those who will come to pass. During this month if you end up visiting his home land of [[About Arenthia/Nations of Arenthia/Laznia\|Laznia]] you would see his worshipers dressing up like him in solidarity of his pain. 

During the [[The World of Havar/Festivals/Festival of the New Moon\|Festival of the New Moon]] for this month it is expected that everyone will have one green lantern in their window if they lost someone in the past year and a blue one if they lost some one in this month. Those with a Blue lantern will receive a Black Rose at their doorstep as if to say that person's spirit has been accepted into the after life. Those with a green lantern receive a white rose to signify their loved one is doing ok and to remind them to be strong

During [[The World of Havar/Festivals/Diety Festicals/Festival of the Spirit God\|Festival of the Spirit God]] on the 20th of Lamiahold, it is a way for the living to remember the dead and for the undead to gather and Praise [[The World of Havar/The gods/Ulfera the Grave Father\|Ulfera the Grave Father]] for giving them life.
