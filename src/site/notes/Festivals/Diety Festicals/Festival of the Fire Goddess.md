### **Her Festival: Festival of the Fire Goddess**

**Date:** 30th of Ignishold  
**Theme:** Renewal, Passion, and Resilience  
Heris’s festival is the climax of Ignishold, a time of celebration and reverence for her fiery essence.

1. **The Flame Parade:**
    
    - Worshippers carry six flaming torches through the streets, lighting bonfires and hearths along the way. The torches represent the six aspects of Heris: warmth, passion, strength, destruction, renewal, and protection.
2. **Fire Dances:**
    
    - Performers clad in flame-colored garments dance around bonfires, their movements imitating the flicker and roar of fire. These dances are both a form of storytelling and a ritual to invoke Heris’s blessings.
3. **Trials of Flame:**
    
    - Contests of endurance and bravery are held, such as walking across heated stones or forging intricate items in record time. Victors are believed to carry Heris’s favor for the year.
4. **Offerings of Flame:**
    
    - Communities gather to cast offerings into a grand bonfire. Items symbolizing past struggles are burned, signifying renewal and moving forward.
5. **Aurora of Flame:**
    
    - At night, Heris’s influence is said to manifest in fiery auroras that dance across the sky, a sign of her approval and presence.
