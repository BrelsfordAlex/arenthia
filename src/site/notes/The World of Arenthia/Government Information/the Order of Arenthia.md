### **The Order's Origin**  

The Order was founded in the year **2400**, a turning point in Arenthia’s history. The years leading up to its formation were marked by relentless wars and conflicts that decimated nations and left scars on the land and its people.  

Recognizing the futility of continuous fighting, the top officials and leaders of the six major nations convened in **[[Nations of Arenthia/Itera\|Itera]]**, home of the Flame Queen Heris, whose symbolic warmth and fire were seen as an omen of renewal.  

At this first meeting, a **Charter of Unity** was drafted, outlining the principles of the Order:  
- Commitment to peace.  
- Cooperation for the common good.  
- Preservation of each nation’s unique identity and sovereignty.  

The Life Tree itself was invoked as a symbol of interconnectedness, its roots and branches reflecting the unity and individuality of the member nations.

   - The Council votes on matters brought to the Order, with decisions requiring a majority to pass.  

2. **High Steward:**  
   - A rotating position, the High Steward is chosen every six years from one of the member nations. They oversee meetings, mediate disputes, and ensure fairness in decision-making.  

3. **Halls of Unity:**  
   - The headquarters of the Order is located in **[[Nations of Arenthia/Oceron\|Oceron]]**, a grand structure with six wings representing each nation and a central chamber where the Council convenes.
