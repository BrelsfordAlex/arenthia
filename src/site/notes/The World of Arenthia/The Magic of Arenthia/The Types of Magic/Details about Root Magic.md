### **Root Magic: The Magic of the Life Tree**

**Root Magic** is one of the most ancient and revered forms of magic in Arenthia, directly tied to the **Life Tree** and the natural flow of the world. It is instinctive, harmonious, and deeply connected to the land, drawing its strength from the roots that spread throughout Arenthia.

### **1. Connection to the Life Tree**

Root Magic users are individuals with a strong natural connection to the Life Tree’s energy. This connection is not uniform and varies from person to person:

- **Innate Bond:** Those born with a natural affinity for Root Magic feel the Life Tree's energy as an extension of their own being.
- **Localized Nodes:** [[Nations of Arenthia/the Life Tree\|the Life Tree]]’s roots create magical hotspots (sometimes visible as **[[The World of Arenthia/The Tetra Crystals\|The Tetra Crystals]]**) that amplify Root Magic.

    - **Calmness:** Enables precise control and sustainable effects.

    - **Water:** Summoning rain, purifying water, or controlling rivers.
    - **Air:** Summoning winds, calming storms, or aiding flight.
    - **Fire:** Harnessing natural flames, often in controlled, life-giving ways like warming the cold.

#### **D. Living Energy**
