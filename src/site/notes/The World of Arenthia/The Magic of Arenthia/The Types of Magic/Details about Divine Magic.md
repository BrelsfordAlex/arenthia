### **Divine Magic: The Power of Faith and the Gods**

**Divine Magic** is a sacred form of magic in Arenthia, granted by the gods to their worshippers. Unlike other forms of magic, it does not come from personal talent or the Life Tree’s connection but through devotion, prayer, and alignment with the values and domains of the gods. Divine Magic is a reflection of the deity’s will and the practitioner’s faith.
