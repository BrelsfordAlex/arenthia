# About The Kor
---
The Kor have existed in the world of Arenthia for as long as the Life Tree has existed. When [[Nations of Arenthia/the Life Tree\|the Life Tree]] first sprouted these [[The World of Arenthia/The Tetra Crystals\|blue crystals (also known as Tetra Crystals)]] appeared all over the world of Arenthia and out from these crystals came The Kor. Nowadays the Kor can be seen flocked near major blue crystal hubs, places such as The Mages Isle on [[Nations of Arenthia/Ashea\|Ashea]].

The Kor are a species of the llght. The Tetra Crystals seem to enhance their connection to Magic. The Kor have an innate connection to these crystals, sometimes even being guided to live near clusters of them. If a Kor cannot sense the crystals call to them, they tend to be guided to The Life Tree and they life at the base of it in [[Nations of Arenthia/Oceron\|Oceron]].

When the Kor get older, they visit the Mages at [[Nations of Arenthia/the Life Tree\|the Life Tree]] or The Mages on [[Nations of Arenthia/Ashea\|Ashea]]. which puts the Kor through a test to see how strong their connection to the Crystals is, the stronger the connection the more crystals they can imbue into their body and/or use as weapons and materials. 

With their connection to [[Nations of Arenthia/the Life Tree\|the Life Tree]] the Kor have offered to keep a watch on the prison, using their connection to [[The World of Arenthia/The Tetra Crystals\|The Tetra Crystals]] to make it so no prisoners escape. They also use these crystals to allow the High Council of Laznia and Astaria to communicate without anyone listening in.

**The Kor do not share their secrets of the Tetra Crystals or even about their species to anyone who is not of Kor blood. To other species this race is a mystery and unknown force that is seemingly connected to The life Tree**


# About the Kor Made Weapons
---
The Kor using the magic of the crystals to power their weapons The Kor use these crystals for weapons, communication, magical conductors, even in their own body to enchance their skills. The more Tetra crystals a Kor has imbued into their body, the stronger and more adept they are at what they do. 

The Kor have several options for weapons using the Tetra Crystals, they can take chunks of the crystals and put it into wood from [[Nations of Arenthia/the Life Tree\|the Life Tree]] to create this sturdy weapon. While this weapon is being made, the intent the Kor has on it will shape it. If the Kor would want the weapon to be a bow, it will turn into a bow that allows for their magic and the Tetra Crystals to work at their best. Some Kor prefer having weapons made of pure Tetra Crystal, and others only need a little bit. 

These weapons when activated emit a blue bright glow, that while it isn't hurt to look at; if you look at it to long you will start to hear the voices of the Life Tree and end up going insane.
