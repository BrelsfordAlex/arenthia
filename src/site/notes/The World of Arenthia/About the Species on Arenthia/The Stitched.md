# About the Stitched
---
the Stitched are a race **Exclusive** to [[Nations of Arenthia/Laznia and Astaria\|Laznia and Astaria]] that are a Frankenstein like creature that has many different species stitched together and powered with a [[The World of Arenthia/The Tetra Crystals\|Tetra Crystal]] heart. These creatures cannot eat or sleep, yet they dream when they lay down.  These creatures tend to gravitate towards the vampiric houses of [[Nations of Arenthia/Laznia and Astaria\|Laznia and Astaria]] some even tend to work for them or just live near them. While they can die it would be hard to kill one due to the fact that you would have to rip its heart out and all Stitched are infused with magics that are not of this era.
