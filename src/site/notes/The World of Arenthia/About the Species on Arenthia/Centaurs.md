# The Basics of the Centaurs
---
Centaurs did not exist in the world before, they are a result of the war from before the tree ( see [[The World of Arenthia/The gods/Where all the gods came from\|Where all the gods came from]] for more). The excess magic from the original gods lingers within all Centaurs. They all hold some connection to magic itself. As a result most Centaurs use basic magic in their day to day life.

**Please keep in mind the "what they could look like" sections is just options. Just try to stick to the species they are**

###### About the Giraffe Centaurs
These Centaurs have the spots of any species of Giraffe, even on their non-Giraffe body. The other half can be any other species in the [[The World of Arenthia/About the Species on Arenthia/The Species of Arenthia\|Usual Species (Traditional)]] in the species document. Every Giraffe-Centaur has the ossicones (the horns) of a giraffe. These centaurs tend to be from [[Nations of Arenthia/Eshya\|Eshya]] and [[Nations of Arenthia/Ashea\|Ashea]].

These Centaurs are very welcoming and kind; though if they perceive anyone as hostile the older males will attack without warning. They also tend to live about as long as their other half (Example: if the other half is a human then they would live about as long as humans)

###### the history of Giraffe Centaurs
There are rumors among the centaurs that the Giraffe Centaurs existed before the tree; though the records of then are long sealed away. The oldest of these Centaurs is about 3,247 at minimum, being the oldest elf/elf hybrid. Her name is [[The World of Arenthia/Notable People (Still Alive)/Yania the Wise One\|Yania the Wise One]] she is a nomad that wanders through [[Nations of Arenthia/Eshya\|Eshya]] and [[Nations of Arenthia/Ashea\|Ashea]]. Many centaurs seek her help when they are having issues.

###### About the Horse Centaurs
These are just the atypical centaurs you will find about almost all the continents. They can be seen even in busy capitals helping about with however they can. The other half can be any other species in the [[The World of Arenthia/About the Species on Arenthia/The Species of Arenthia\|Usual Species (Traditional)]] in the species document. Some are seen as guides and even Mercenaries. These are the most common Centaurs you will find in Arenthia

###### About the Zebra Centaurs
The Zebra Centaurs follow the grazing patterns of the Giraffe Centaurs, by occupying [[Nations of Arenthia/Eshya\|Eshya]] mainly. They are  herd mentality species and tend to get lost very easily. The other half can be any other species in the [[The World of Arenthia/About the Species on Arenthia/The Species of Arenthia\|Usual Species (Traditional)]] in the species document.

These centaurs are known for wandering off and being kind to strangers however, so if you see one approach do not be scared that is just them being curious. If you are seen as a threat however the herd will stampede on you. 

These Centaurs have the stripes of a Zebra.

###### About the Deer/Elk Centaurs
Deer/Elk Centaurs tend to roam the woods of [[Nations of Arenthia/Itera\|Itera]], protecting the forests. These Centaur species are more magically inclined than the rest of the Centaurs. they tend to have a Herd mentality and the other half can be any other species in the [[The World of Arenthia/About the Species on Arenthia/The Species of Arenthia\|Usual Species (Traditional)]] in the species document. Though because they are more magically inclined, there will be more traits of the Deer/Elk than the other species. 

These centaurs are very wary of people they don't know. If you come to close to them they will end up running away; unless they know your scent of course.
