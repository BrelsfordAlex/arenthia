# About the Crystals of Tetra
---
The blue crystals come from [[Nations of Arenthia/the Life Tree\|the Life Tree]], when parts of a giant crystal are taken off over time that bit tends to grow back and the crystal grows larger.  When [[Nations of Arenthia/the Life Tree\|the Life Tree]] first sprouted these blue crystals appeared all over the world of [[Arenthia\|Arenthia]] and out from these crystals came [[About the Species on Arenthia/The Kor\|The Kor]].

The Kor have an innate connection to these crystals, sometimes even being guided to live near clusters of them. If a Kor cannot sense the crystals call to them, they tend to be guided to The Life Tree and they life at the base of it in [[Nations of Arenthia/Oceron\|Oceron]].

The Tetra Crystals can grow to be about half the height of the Life Tree and are as strong as Obsidian. Only the Kor know and can use this material. If a non-Kor touches the Tetra Crystals, that shard of Tetra either will explode or power down and be useless even if its brought to a cluster. 

These Tetra crystals can fuse with one another if handled properly. 

The Kor can use these crystals to communicate to other crystals from the same cluster.
