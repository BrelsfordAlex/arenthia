# How Ulfera is Worshiped
---
#### In the Deadlands (Laznia and Astaria)
 if you are from the Deadland Alliance ( [[Nations of Arenthia/Laznia\|Laznia]] and [[Nations of Arenthia/Astaria\|Astaria]]) Ulfera is the main deity. It is passed along in the Deadland Alliance that Ulfera himself created the lands of [[Nations of Arenthia/Laznia\|Laznia]] and [[Nations of Arenthia/Astaria\|Astaria]] just for those of the undead variety because he saw them being secluded and fears by some of the other races in [[The World of Arenthia/Welcome to Arenthia\|Arenthia]].

**In this section will be how court wants the Deadland Alliance to worship Ulfera**

#### The rest of Arenthia
In Arenthia there is several shrines located across each of the continents. The shrines are always exist inside of graveyards, located directly in the center looking like this

In the center of the shrine is a offering bowl that has the symbol of Ulfera in the center.

One of the common phrases of when honoring the dead is "Honor Thy Grave Father. Let the Dead Sleep in Peace." This phrase is written on the rocks on the shrines of Ulfera.

When someone goes to the gravesite to honor their past loved ones, they will place a piece of paper with that person's name inside the bowl. If the paper catches fire; the person is safe inside the Deadlands, if the paper rips into pieces the person is still traveling, and if the paper isn't touched then their state of being is unknown to the Grave Father. 

##### When Someone Dies
When someone dies what happens is their loved ones are approached by the followers of Ulfera. The followers of Ulfera always come in 3s. One representing the person's death(the Deathseer), one representing their deeds in life(The Scales), and one representing their memories(The Mind),

The Deathseer stands at the dead person's feet and The Scales stands at the head and The Mind places their hands one at the heart and one at the stomach.

In that moment the The Mind uses their connection to magic to levitate the body and the three of them walk to the nearest body of water and the body is placed in the boat and the 3 followers of Ulfera guide the body to The Deadlands ([[Nations of Arenthia/Laznia\|Laznia]] and [[Nations of Arenthia/Astaria\|Astaria]]). While the body travels, the family of the loved ones hold a funeral and a gravestone is placed in honor of the loved one.
