# How Thenaris is worshipped
---
Thenaris is seen as the mother of everything the Elves hold dear. she is often seen in [[Nations of Arenthia/Oceron\|Yaa Serine]] walking amongst the people and helping those she sees as lesser than her. For the elves how they worship her is by offering their services to her if she may call upon them. If she needed them for war, they would go to war. If she needed them to uproot everything and start over they would. 

In her Temples you can see the stars no matter the time of day. Her temples boost the strength of divination magic.
