### **Before the Tree**

The time before the **Life Tree** is shrouded in mystery, known only through fragmented legends and ancient relics scattered across Arenthia. This was an age when the gods, as they are revered today, were mortal adventurers—heroes struggling against the chaos of a world on the brink of collapse. The gods of the old world, long forgotten and unnamed, wielded immense power but were unable to maintain balance. In a desperate final act, they pooled their energy to create the **Life Tree**, sacrificing their existence to give rise to a new world.

The Life Tree did more than birth a new age—it elevated six heroes to godhood:
	[[The World of Arenthia/The gods/Ulfera the Grave Father\|Ulfera the Grave Father]]
	[[The World of Arenthia/The gods/Rania the Wind Mother\|Rania the Wind Mother]]
	[[The World of Arenthia/The gods/Lycus The Harvest King\|Lycus The Harvest King]]
	[[The World of Arenthia/The gods/Heris The Flame Queen\|Heris The Flame Queen]]
	[[The World of Arenthia/The gods/Thenaris The Mother of All\|Thenaris The Mother of All]]
	[[The World of Arenthia/The gods/Zephus The Abyssal Sovereign\|Zephus The Abyssal Sovereign]]

When the Life Tree sprouted, its roots pierced through the dying old world, breaking it apart. The continents and lands of the old world were destroyed, giving birth to **Arenthia**, a realm shaped by the gods' ascension and the Life Tree's power.

### **The Gods Now**

While the gods wield immense power, they rarely speak of their mortal pasts. There are whispers among scholars and worshippers that the holy lands they now govern—**[[Nations of Arenthia/Itera\|Itera]], [[Nations of Arenthia/Obasa\|Obasa]], [[Nations of Arenthia/Eshya\|Eshya]], [[Nations of Arenthia/Oceron\|Oceron]], [[Nations of Arenthia/Laznia\|Laznia]]**—were once the lands of their origin as mortals. However, the gods neither confirm nor deny these claims, leaving their mortal pasts cloaked in secrecy.

**[[Nations of Arenthia/the Life Tree\|the Life Tree]]e's Connection:** The gods remain deeply tied to the Life Tree, drawing power from its existence. It is believed that their influence wanes the farther they move from its roots, anchoring their domains to specific continents.

When the Life Tree sprouted, it also gave birth to the **Kor**, beings of immense power tied to the **Tetra Crystals**, which radiate energy from the Tree itself. The Kor are seen as the Life Tree’s guardians, though their true purpose remains enigmatic.

### **The Old World’s End**

The transition from the old world to Arenthia was cataclysmic. Many of the old world’s races, including **Halflings, Dwarves, Gnolls, Gremlins, Trolls**, and **Orcs**, were lost in the upheaval. Whether they were wiped out by the gods' ascension or simply unable to adapt to the new world is unknown. Their absence is a somber reminder of the destruction that accompanied creation.

**New Species:** In the wake of the Life Tree’s growth, new species emerged, shaped by its influence. These include many of the races now thriving in Arenthia, such as those seen in **[[The World of Arenthia/About the Species on Arenthia/The Species of Arenthia\|The Species of Arenthia]]**.

### **Remnants of the Old World**

Though much of the old world has faded into myth, remnants persist:

- **The Warforged:**
    
    - **Metal Warforged** are seen as relics of the old world, their existence tied to technology and magic alien to the gods. They are viewed with suspicion, labeled as "godless" by many in Arenthia.
    - **Wooden Warforged**, however, are believed to have been remade in harmony with the Life Tree. They are accepted and even revered by some as beings aligned with divine will.
- **The [[The World of Arenthia/About the Species on Arenthia/Centaurs\|Centaurs]]:**  
    While Centaurs are native to Arenthia, their magic originates from the old world. This connection sets them apart, and their magic is often studied for clues about the time before the Tree.

### **Other Mysteries**

- **The Lost Races:**  
    Artifacts and ruins suggest the old races might not be entirely gone. Some believe they retreated to hidden realms or were transformed by the Life Tree into something unrecognizable.
- **Fragments of the Old Gods:**  
    Ancient texts hint that traces of the old gods' power still linger in the world, buried deep beneath Arenthia's surface or hidden in forgotten relics.

The story of **Before the Tree** is both a tale of creation and destruction, a reminder that the gods themselves are not infallible. Their pasts, shrouded in secrecy, leave mortals to wonder if the sacrifices of the old world were truly necessary—or if the cost of Arenthia's birth was too high.
